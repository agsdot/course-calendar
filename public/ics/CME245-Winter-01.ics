DESCRIPTION:Description: Introduction to Energy and Commodity Markets (energy, metals, agriculturals, livestock) and issues related to renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, and carbon emissions. Topics include: application of financial mathematics and dynamic game theory to a variety of problems, including forward curve models, oligoply models of energy production, financialization of commodity markets, and carbon emissions markets; traditional stochastic models for commodity futures curves. Schwartz models, capturing backwardation and contango, Samuelson effect, convenience yield and storage; game theoretic models of energy production. Cournot models, exhaustible resources, Hotelling&iquest;s rule, impact of renewables and shale oil (fracking). Stochastic differential games, and continuum mean field games.nPart 3: Financialization. Intertwining of equity and commodity markets through modern investment vehicles such as ETFs and commodity index funds. Models for carbon emissions markets. Prerequisites:familiarity with stochastic calculus (CME 308) and partial differential equations (CME303/306), or similar classes by consent of . May be repeat for credit
