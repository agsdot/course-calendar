DESCRIPTION:This seminar will examine the tension in American foreign policy between pursuing U.S. security and economic interests and promoting American values abroad.  The course will retrace the theoretical and ideological debates about values versus interests, with a particular focus on realism versus liberalism.  The course will examine the evolution of these debates over time, starting with the French revolution, but with special attention given to the Cold War, American foreign policy after September 11th, and the Obama administration.  The course also will examine how these contending theories and ideologies are mediated through the U.S. bureaucracy that shapes the making of foreign policy. ** NOTE:  The enrollment of the class is by application only. Please provide a one page double-spaced document outlining previous associated coursework and why you want to enroll in the seminar to Anna Coll (acoll@stanford.edu) by February 22nd. Any questions related to this course can be directed to Anna Coll.
