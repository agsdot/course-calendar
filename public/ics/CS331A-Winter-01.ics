DESCRIPTION:The field of computer vision has seen an explosive growth in past decade. Much of recent effort in vision research is towards developing algorithms that can perform high-level visual recognition tasks on real-world images and videos. With development of Internet, this task becomes particularly challenging and interesting given the heterogeneous data on the web. Course will focus on reading recent research papers that are focused on solving high-level visual recognition problems, such as object recognition and categorization, scene understanding, human motion understanding, etc. Project required. Prerequisite: some experience in research with one of the following fields: computer vision, image processing, computer graphics, machine learning.
