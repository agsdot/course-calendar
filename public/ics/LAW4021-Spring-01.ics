DESCRIPTION:Taught by top policy leaders from Google/YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, this course will explore the way free speech norms have evolved in the age of the Internet and the pivotal role online platforms play in the information available worldwide. From the content policy issues that evolved in the face of violent geopolitical disputes (from the Arab Spring to the Ukraine), to the Right to be Forgotten in Europe, the challenges posed by terrorist propaganda online, and the role platforms play in social movements like #blacklivesmatter, this course will allow students to critically engage the balance between freedom of information and other important social values, such as privacy and security.  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), with consent of the instructor.  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, Class Participation, Written Assignments; Exam or Final Paper.
