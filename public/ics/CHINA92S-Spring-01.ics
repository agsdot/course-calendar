DESCRIPTION:Shanghai is both China's most modern city and the country's gateway to the world. Among the makers of the city&iquest;s modern preeminence were not only its indigenous peoples and ideas, but also loans from British banks, films of Hollywood, policemen from colonial India, and revolutionary thoughts imported from Japan. This course will situate Shanghai's transnational history and its role in the formation of modern China from mid-nineteenth century onward. Key themes include Western and Japanese colonialisms, the rise of Chinese capitalism, WWII, the Cultural Revolution, and the still ongoing economic reform. This course fulfills the departmental Sources and Methods requirement.
