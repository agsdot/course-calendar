DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 746)  This course will advance students' understanding of economic, legal, and political approaches to avoiding or managing the problem of global climate change.  Beyond focusing on economic issues and legal constraints, it will address the political economy of various emissions-reduction strategies. The course will consider policy efforts at the local, national, and international levels.  Theoretical contributions as well as empirical analyses will be considered.  Specific topics include:  interactions among overlapping climate policies and between new policies and  pre-existing legal or regulatory frameworks; the role that jurisdictional or geographic scale can play in influencing the performance of climate policy approaches; and numerical modeling and statistical analyses of climate change policies.  Elements used in grading:  Class Participation, Written Assignments, Final Exam.  Cross-listed with Economics (ECON 159).
