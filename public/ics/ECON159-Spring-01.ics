DESCRIPTION:This course will advance students understanding of economic, legal, and political approaches to avoiding or managing the problem of global climate change.  Theoretical contributions as well as empirical analyses will be considered. In addition to examining economic issues and legal constraints, it will address the political economy of various emissions-reduction strategies. The course will consider policy efforts at the local, national, and international levels.  Specific topics include:  interactions among overlapping climate policies and between new policies and  pre-existing legal or regulatory frameworks; the role that jurisdictional or geographic scale can play in influencing the performance of climate-policy approaches; and numerical modeling and statistical analyses of climate-change policies. Cross-listed with Law 2502 (formally Law 746). Prerequisites: Econ 50 or its equivalent.
