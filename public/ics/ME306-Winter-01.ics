DESCRIPTION:What is high performance in design? How could you improve your performance as a designer? Theories and frameworks from research into engineering design and design thinking are translated into action for developing insights into your design behavior and to develop strategies to improve design performance. Focus on performance in four aspects of design thinking: design as social activity, cognitive activity, physical activity and learning activity. Practice of effective team behaviors for concept generation, decision-making, and conflict-handling. Cognitive strategies from design as problem-solving, design as reflection-in-action, and C-K Theory. Prototyping performance improvements through media cascade and boundary object frameworks. Application of Perception-Action framework for improving self-learning in design. Students engage in multiple projects and a lab component.
