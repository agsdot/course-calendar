DESCRIPTION:No period in American history has generated as much creative political thinking as the era of the American Revolution. This course explores the origins and development of that thought from the onset of the dispute between Great Britain and its American colonies over liberty and governance through the debates surrounding the construction and implementation of the United States&iquest; Federal Constitution. Readings will principally be based in primary sources with some weeks supplemented by secondary sources.
