DESCRIPTION:In most real-world problems, decision-makers often face uncertainty with respect to the underlying modelsnnthat drive the rewards/costs associated with potential strategies. The uncertainty in the problem can bennmodeled in a number of ways (e.g., a probability distribution over some parameters or an uncertainty setnnfor some variables) and a selection of an appropriate framework depends on various considerations rangingnnfrom the availability of historical data (or lack thereof) to the robustness of resulting strategies or thenntractability of the formulation. In addition, once a framework is selected, further challenges often arise whennnconsidering dynamic settings, in which the level of uncertainty may be updated from one period to another.nnThe high-level objectives of this course are:nn1. to introduce various frameworks for decision-making under model uncertaintynn2. to introduce tools to solve such problems, including ones to develop optimal or near-optimal learningnnstrategiesnn3. to discuss the various tradeoffs that arise such as tractability vs. performance, exploration vs. exploitation, and remembering vs. forgettingnn4. to explore research papers that demonstrate applications of discussed methods and models to variousnnproblems areas such as dynamic pricing, revenue management, inventory management, and assortmentnnselection
