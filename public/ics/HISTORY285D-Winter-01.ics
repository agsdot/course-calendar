DESCRIPTION:Since Russia annexed territories formerly belonging to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and absorbed that region's large Jewish community, Russia has been a center of the Jewish world. Russia's Jews have been a potent force in the Jewish world as they struggled against discrimination, pursued utopian dreams, and devoted themselves to religious, cultural, and political movements. This course will introduce students to the history of Russian Jews, in the hope that they will gain a deeper understanding of this fascinating community.
