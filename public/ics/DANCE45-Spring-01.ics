DESCRIPTION:This class will explore art/artists on the fringe of of the visual arts, projecting their work through performance. Class will consist of visiting artists, short readings, field trips, and a culminating performance to take place in the Anderson Collection. Through the exploration of these cross-disciplinary projects, students will gain a better understanding of the history of performance art, specifically in visual arts spaces; meet practicing artists; visit galleries, museums, and alternative art spaces in the Bay Area; and explore the artistic strategies used in performance or body based disciplines in order to create new, innovative or transformative ways of being and doing. Embodied thinking and improvisation is the primary methodology through which creative strategies, processes and practices are applied in both art and non-art contexts.
