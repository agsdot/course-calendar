DESCRIPTION:This seminar examines the origins, growth and risks of Knowledge-based ecosystems. Is Silicon Valley sustainable and replicable? Where is 1960's Boston Route 128 innovation hub today? Are the Golden Triangle (Oxford, Cambridge, London)  Moscow's Skolkovo; North Carolina's Research Triangle; France's Sophia Antipolis and other wannabe Silicon Landscapes  viable? What is the role of Civil Society, gender balance and diversity, the arts and sciences: natural and social in innovation policy and practice? Innovation in innovation is the invention of organizational formats that facilitate product, process and social innovation. Start-ups and spin-offs, the Entrepreneurial University and  Public Venture Capital and have been innovation drivers but are they sufficient? Can debt funded R&amp;D sustain innovation? We will study the Stanford Innovation System and publish our results.
