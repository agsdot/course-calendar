LOCATION:Li Ka Shing Center, room 209
DESCRIPTION:Focus is on first principles and methods of advanced computational and systems immunology that are used in the analysis of protein and nucleic acid sequences, protein structures, and immunological processes. Students learn to write computational algorithms for sequence alignment, motif finding, expression array analysis, structural modeling, structure design and prediction, and network analysis and modeling. Students become familiar with the technologies used in CSI, which include dynamic programming, Markov and hidden Markov models, Bayesian networks, clustering methods, and energy minimization approaches. Designed for students with strong foundations in either immunology or computer science . Prerequisites: lmmunol 207, CS 109 and CS 161.
