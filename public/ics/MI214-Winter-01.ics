DESCRIPTION:We focus on how our bodies function as systems that live peacefully with helpful microbes and their own cells but must defend themselves against pathogens and cancer and sometimes make mistakes which lead to autoimmunity and allergy. We will cove the immune system and its interactions with other physiological systems (e.g., immune-nuero axis). Topics covered include: innate immune receptors; pathogen killing mechanisms; avoidance vs. resistance vs. disease tolerance; trained immunity; metabolism; antigen-presenting cells; cellular immune responses (innate and adaptive) against viruses, bacteria and parasites; cancer, autoimmunity and allergies; immunotherapies and vaccines.
