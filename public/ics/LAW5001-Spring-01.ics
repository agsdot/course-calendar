DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 245)  This introductory course provides an overview of the Chinese legal system and business environment and examines Chinese legal rules and principles in select business-related areas. These areas include intellectual property, dispute resolution, foreign investment vehicles, mergers and acquisitions, antimonopoly law, and environment. Through active class participation and analysis of legal and business cases, students will learn both the law in the books and the law in action, as well as strategies that businesses could use to overcome limitations in the Chinese legal system. Leaders from the law and business community will be invited to share their experiences and insights. This course is particularly suitable for law students and students enrolled in the MBA program and/or the East Asian Studies Program. Undergraduates who have permission from the instructor may also take this course. A Stanford Non-Law Student Course Registration Form is available on the SLS Registrar's Office website. Elements used in grading: Class participation (30%) and extended take-home exam (70%).
