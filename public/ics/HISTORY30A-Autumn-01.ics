DESCRIPTION:Explores the history of medical institutions, ideas and practices in the United States from the early nineteenth century to the present.

Topics include the transformation of therapeutics and technologies, medicine and the scientific ideal in the U.S., gender and race and medicine, the history of public health, and the professionalization and specialization of American medical practice.
