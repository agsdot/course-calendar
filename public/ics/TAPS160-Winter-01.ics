LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:The ballerina occupies a unique place in popular imagination as an object of over-determined femininity as well as an emblem of extreme physical accomplishment for the female dancer. This seminar is designed as an investigation into histories of the ballerina as an iconographic symbol and cultural reference point for challenges to political and gender ideals. Through readings, videos, discussions and viewings of live performances this class  investigates pivotal works, artists and eras in the global histories of ballet from its origins as a symbol of patronage and power in the 15th  century through to its radical experiments as a site of cultural obedience and disobedience in the 20th and 21st centuries.
