DESCRIPTION:In this seminar, we shall read Aristotle's Protrepticus. This is an early work of Aristotle that attempts to turn the reader to a philosophic life and it is by far the least read of his works on ethics.  It was only recovered in the 19th century and only in the past 15 years or so do we have a reliable text.  Thus studies of it are very much underdeveloped.  We shall also read as background some other protreptic works by Plato and the rhetorician Isocrates. 2 unit option is only for Philosophy PhD students beyond the second year.
