DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 222)  The course is designed to prepare law students for research in practice and clerkships. The course will review sources of legal authority and how this material is used, organized, published, indexed, and kept current. Objectives for the course are: 1) to show students how to find and evaluate legal research sources and use them effectively, with particular emphasis on cost-effective research; 2) to expand research skills in primary and secondary U.S. legal sources; and 3) to introduce students to the array of non-legal information resources useful to legal practice. Learning legal research requires a hands-on approach, so students will complete in-class exercises, homework assignments, and quizzes -- all of which contribute to grading. There will not be a final exam.  This course is open to Stanford graduate students with permission from the instructor.
