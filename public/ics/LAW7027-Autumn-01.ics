DESCRIPTION:This reading group will investigate unresolved issues in Critical Race Theory. Questions explored will include: What exactly are advocates for racial justice fighting for? That is, what does racial justice look like? What is the place of &quot;culture&quot; in our racial present and in a racial utopia? What are the roles of agency and structure -- individuals and institutions -- in perpetuating, and remedying, racial inequality? What is the role of law in undermining and/or entrenching racial stratification? Readings will be highly varied, coming from the fields of law, psychology, sociology, and anthropology, among others. Meeting Dates:  This class will meet 4:15PM - 7:15PM on Thursday,  September 29, October 27 and November 17.  Elements used in grading:  Grading will be based on participation, short reaction/response papers, and a final paper.
