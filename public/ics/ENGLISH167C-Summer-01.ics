DESCRIPTION:African-American culture critic Greg Tate once remarked that &iquest;Black people live the estrangement that science fiction authors imagine&iquest;.  In light of his observation, this course proposes to look at the black science fiction (SF) tradition from a variety of angles.  Some examples:  How do black authors use familiar speculative tropes, such as encounters with aliens, to comment on matters of race?  What happens when tropes from African-American realist fiction, such as the passing narrative, become science fictionalized?  How does the intersection of race and gender affect speculative works by black women?  And perhaps the most central question: What do we gain by looking at matters of race through the lens of SF?
