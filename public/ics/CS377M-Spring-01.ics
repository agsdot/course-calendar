DESCRIPTION:Mixed Reality (MR) combines physical and virtual worlds together in one unified user experience. With Oculus Rift and Microsoft Hololens releasing in 2016, MR represents the forefront of HCI innovation. In this course, students engage with a range of issues around design and development of MR systems and develop their own MR interactions. The course begins with use, analysis, and redesign of an existing MR system, followed by larger group projects integrating concepts from the course to prototype novel MR interactions. Students work in project teams, prototyping their concept and communicating their progress through demonstration, final report, and presentation. Prerequisites: CS 147 or 247.
