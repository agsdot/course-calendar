LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:*ONLINE Offering of BIOE103.  This pilot class, BIOE103B, is an entirely online offering with the same content, learning goals, and prerequisites as BIOE103.  Students attend class by watching videos and completing assignments remotely.  Students may attend recitation and office hours in person, but cannot attend the BIOE103 in-person lecture due to room capacity restraints.*  Physiology of intact human tissues, organs, and organ systems in health and disease, and bioengineering tools used (or needed) to probe and model these physiological systems. Topics: Clinical physiology, network physiology and system design/plasticity, diseases and interventions (major syndromes, simulation, and treatment, instrumentation for intervention, stimulation, diagnosis, and prevention), and new technologies including tissue engineering and optogenetics.  Discussions of pathology of these systems in a clinical-case based format, with a view towards identifying unmet clinical needs.  Learning computational skills that not only enable simulation of these systems but also apply more broadly to biomedical data analysis. Prerequisites: MATH 41, 42; CME 102; PHY 41; BIO 41, 42; strongly recommended PHY 43; or instructor approval.
