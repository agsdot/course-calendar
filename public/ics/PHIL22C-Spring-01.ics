DESCRIPTION:A powerful objection from the partiality of love has, for a while now, rankled traditional moral theories that demand impartiality, like utilitarianism and Kantianism. When it comes down to it, all of us would put the interests of our loved ones - family members, close friends, romantic partners - above those of strangers. Love is a central, not a peripheral or peculiar, part of our moral lives. In response some moral theorists have tried to develop richer and more nuanced views to accommodate the partiality that love demands of us. This tutorial will draw from both contemporary moral theory and from historical treatments, trying to answer questions about love that ethicists have often asked about morality: What does love require of me? How much must we sacrifice at the altar of love? What's wrong with someone who doesn't love at all?
