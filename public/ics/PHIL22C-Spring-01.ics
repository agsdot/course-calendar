DESCRIPTION:A powerful objection concerning the partiality of love has, for a while now, rankled traditional moral theories that demand impartiality, like utilitarianism and Kantianism. When it comes down to it, all of us would put the interests of our loved ones - family members, close friends, romantic partners - above those of strangers. But love is a central, not a peripheral, part of our moral lives. In response some moral theorists have tried to develop richer views to accommodate the partiality that love demands of us. This tutorial will draw from both contemporary moral theory and from historical treatments to try to find the place of love within moral theory. Recommended background: Phil 2 or equivalent.
