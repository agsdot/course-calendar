DESCRIPTION:Students continue to use DLSR cameras, with an ongoing emphasis on operating manual settings (focus, aperture, shutter speed, ISO, color temp/ white balance). They are introduced to metering and color temperature, and become adept at using on-camera flashes. They are taught intermediate-level digital printing (in color) using large-format printers. They continue to work with Lightroom as a file management system and are introduced to Photoshop. Students gain a deeper insight into and stronger grasp of practices in contemporary digital photography, with a continuing focus on the importance of photo editing/selection and sequencing, as well as questions around the conceptual and practical implications and limits of photographic images. Prerequisite: ARTSTUDI 171 or equivalent.
