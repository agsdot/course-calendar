DESCRIPTION:The complexity of modern neuroscience requires researchers to develop an interdisciplinary approach. This course explores multiple technologies for understanding the brain and is less a survey of different techniques than a critical comparison of them. With the goal of incorporating a new technique into their own research projects, students will address potential advantages, disadvantages and limitations of various methods. The final two class meetings will be devoted to allowing students to develop a plan to integrate a new technique into their current research projects and receive feedback from the class on how informative and viable their plans may be.
