DESCRIPTION:Though the mystery is often equated with a single genre&iquest;detective fiction&iquest;its literary examples stretch beyond the confines of a particular genre or period. This course focuses on the evolution of the modern mystery plot, tracing a long arc from its emergence in the eighteenth-century Gothic novel to its contemporary reinventions in the television procedural and the true crime podcast. Moving from the medieval castle to the urban street, the open sea to the country estate, we will investigate the extraordinary range and resilience of one of the most fundamental narrative forms across historical contexts. We&iquest;ll analyze the use of serial form in Wilkie Collins&iquest; <i>The Moonstone</i> and the podcast sensation <i>Serial</i>; the invention of the clue and the transformations of the detective in the writings of De Quincey, Poe, Conan Doyle, and Hammett; and the production of suspense in Radcliffe&iquest;s <i>The Mysteries of Udolpho</i> and Melville&iquest;s <i>Benito Cereno.</i> Throughout the course we will pay special attention to the mystery&iquest;s uncertain relationship to the novel, to realism, and to the literary itself.
