DESCRIPTION:Society needs confident, skilled and agile female professionals at every career level, especially in the earlier stages of their career, which provide the platform for future leadership opportunities. Female leaders face the same challenges as male leaders do, but female leaders also encounter an additional set of challenges (sociological, institutional, economic, cultural, social, familial, personal, sexual) that their male counterparts most likely will not. The same is true for female entrepreneurs, board members, managers, CEOs, social changemakers, educators and beyond, regardless of their career stage, access and background. Effectively overcoming female-specific challenges requires awareness, confidence and a practical skill-set that will be developed through an academic grounding in research, frameworks and case studies. Through a personalized learning model, students will apply learnings through active participation in in-class discussions and simulations, directly engage with industry leaders, and develop an individual leadership plan.
