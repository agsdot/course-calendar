DESCRIPTION:This course will teach students the technical processes of silkscreen printing, including: vinyl stencil, sta-sharp film, drawing fluid, photo emulsion, ink mixing, multiple color registration, printing on alternative substrates, and small-run editions. Students will learn about the history of silkscreen printmaking, including its fine art applications as well as its commercial and political uses. They will learn both analog and digital silkscreen processes, making use of the department's vast array of printmaking resources, including digital printing, Photoshop, the vinyl cutter, and photographic exposure. Students will complete four assignments, learning how to create stencils both by hand and with digital processes, as well as multiple color prints and printing on alternative materials. Students will be encouraged to combine analog and digital processes in their silkscreen prints, as well as to experiment with scale, substrate, and installation.
