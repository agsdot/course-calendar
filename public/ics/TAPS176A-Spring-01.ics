DESCRIPTION:This class examines narrative design in performed storytelling, especially live drama, oral storytelling, and radio, and compares it to narrative design in other forms, such as print, photography, and the graphic novel.  After considering what media theory, psychology and neurobiology understand about how different forms of narratives operate on us, students will create  a &quot;base narrative&quot; in print and then versions of that narrative in two different other forms. The goal is for students to understand narrative design principles both across and specific to media forms and be able to apply them to move audiences.  Students will have the opportunity to meet and work with master storytellers from the Moth and with graphic novelists Chris Ware and Marjane Satrapi.
