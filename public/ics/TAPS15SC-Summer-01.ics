LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:In the new millennium, the popularity of TV courtroom drama has been staggering: according to a weekly Nielsen ratings conducted a few years ago, 30 million people watched <i>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</i> in one night, 70 million watched at least one of  the <i>CSI</i> shows, and 40 million watched two other forensic dramas (<i>Without a Trace</i>and <i>Cold Case</i>). These widely popular shows offer a somewhat distorted image of American criminal courtroom. In this class we will go &quot;behind the scenes&quot; to engage in a hands-on investigation of performances in the criminal trials. nWe will begin by visiting Bay Area courthouses to investigate the courtroom as a &quot;set&quot; for powerful legal dramas that are happening there on a daily basis. In these field trips we will also observe the courtroom proceedings and talk to judges and other legal professionals. After this introduction to the real-life courtroom, we will investigate landmark theatrical court dramas. Using mock trial techniques, we will approach playtexts as legal &quot;cases.&quot; We will try to identify weaknesses and strengths of these cases, and then use them as mock trial scenarios. Ultimately, this class engages the questions of what does it take to build a solid courtroom case and how does it differ from a powerful piece of theater. While getting acquainted with both courtroom and theater techniques, we will keep a critical eye on (mis)representations of criminal courtroom in the popular media. No previous experience in acting or mock trials is necessary. The class satisfies the WAYS Creative Expression requirement. Sophomore College Course: Application required, due noon, April 5, 2016.
