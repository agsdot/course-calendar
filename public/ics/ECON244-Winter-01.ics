DESCRIPTION:This course aims at familiarizing students with the frontier empirical, computational, and theoretical tools currently used to address questions in the economics of insurance. Topics include the demand for insurance, the design of risk sharing arrangements, the pricing of insurance contracts, models of competition and equilibrium in insurance markets, adverse selection, moral hazard, the dynamics of insurance and reclassification risk, government interventions in insurance markets, and social insurance design. We will draw on methods from Industrial Organization, Public Economics, Finance, and Contract Theory to address applications in health insurance, annuity markets, financial markets, life insurance, unemployment insurance, and auto insurance. Prerequisites: Micro and Econometrics first year sequences (or equivalent).
