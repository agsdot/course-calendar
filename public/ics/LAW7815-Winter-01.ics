DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 664)  This course offers practical preparation for the practice of the transactional lawyer.  Students learn the foundational tools necessary to write clear, effective, plain language business contracts and analyze business contacts of any kind. Students will also gain an understanding of how to manage complex business transactions and master related topics, such as legal opinions and closings.  The course offers a wide range of realistic drafting and research exercises, completed both inside and outside of class, both individually and collaboratively.  These exercises help students improve their writing and editing skills, and develop sensitivity to the expectations of attorneys and clients with whom they will be working.  Issues related to ethics in a transactional practice will also be addressed.  The course should especially appeal to students interested in working for a law firm and practicing transactional law (be it corporate, venture, debt, intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, real estate, etc.). It will also appeal to those interested in business litigation, or those curious about the work of transactional lawyers.  SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS: Students on the waitlist for the course will be admitted if spots are available on the basis of priority and Degree of Study. Early drop deadline: Students may not drop this course after first week of class. Corporations (Law 242) is a prerequisite for all but LLM (CGP) students. Due to an overlap in content, students may not take both Advanced Legal Writing: The Art of the Deal and Advanced Legal Writing: Business Transactions. Elements used in grading: Class participation, attendance, written assignments, and final paper. Important Note: All class sections with Marilyn Bautista will be graded on a Mandatory Pass/Restricted Credit/Fail basis. All class sections with Jason Meek will be graded on an Honors/Pass/Restricted Credit/Fail basis.
