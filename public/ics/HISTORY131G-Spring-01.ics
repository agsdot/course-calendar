DESCRIPTION:This course surveys the origins and impact of encounters at several sites of European empires: Qing China, India, Africa, the Pacific, and the Caribbean. The course conducts its inquiry from several angles, focusing on the way Western imperial systems affected politics, law, economics, and culture. Students will grapple with key concepts, including financial imperialism and neocolonialism; they will also learn about such specialized topics as the laws of imperial expansion. While the course will spend ample time covering the effects of imperialism at home, it will equally engage with its effects abroad.
