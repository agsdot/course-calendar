LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:For many, Herman Melville&iquest;s Moby-Dick is the greatest novel in all of American literature, an undisputed classic.  When Moby-Dick was first published, however, it was a critical and commercial failure. This class will encourage students to reflect on the nature of literary experience by staging an initial reading of Moby-Dick followed by a somewhat abbreviated second reading. We will consider why readers overlooked Moby-Dick when it was originally published, and why readers later, after a second closer inspection, gained a greater appreciation for the novel. We will think about what happens when we encounter a text for the first time, and how different kinds of meaning might accumulate over multiple readings. We will also watch film adaptations of Moby-Dick in an attempt to comprehend how filmmakers over the course of the twentieth century have re-presented the novel to audiences. In the end, this course offers students the chance to study a literary classic in depth. We will read and reread Moby-Dick to better understand how literature works, and how American literary history has taken shape.
