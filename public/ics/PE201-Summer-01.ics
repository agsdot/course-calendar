LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:Of all the social institutions that social scientists study - family, religion, government, medicine, race - sport is arguably the least studied in proportion to its societal impact. Sport plays a pervasive role in almost of of our lives as fans, players, and consumers. Despite this omnipresence, sports remain an understudied topic. This course will attempt to analyze the ubiquity and impact of sports. We will explore the topic of sport from a critical perspective focusing especially on inequalities in gender, race, class, and power. The course will jointly examine sports as a social mirror that reflects status inequalities as well as the role of sports in perpetuating social inequalities.
