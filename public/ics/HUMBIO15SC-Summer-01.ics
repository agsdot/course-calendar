LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:This course uses the diverse parks and reserves of Patagonia as a laboratory for understanding the pros and cons of protected area conservation as they impact flora, fauna, and local people.  We will explore national parks and protected areas (PAs) in both Argentina and Chile, as well as the flourishing establishment of private parks and reserves in the region. We will use a series of case studies to ask: (1) What approach to protected area (PA) conservation has been taken in each case? Who are/were the key proponents and what are/were their main objectives? Was climate change taken into account and if so, how? (2) What have been the main costs and benefits of the PA, and who has received them?  Where benefits are not commensurate to costs what is being done to address the imbalance? And (3) Are there alternatives or variations-on-the-theme of protected area conservation that would be more beneficial for wildlife and local people?  How could the interests of parks and people be made more compatible in each case?  Throughout the course we will look for ways to achieve conservation in a manner that is socially just, biologically successful, and beneficial to local livelihoods.nnThe class will begin on the Stanford campus at the same time as other Sophomore College courses.  But on Sept. 12 we depart on an intensive thirteen-day expedition (at no extra cost) to Argentina and Chile to observe firsthand many of the conservation issues and successes discussed in class. For this portion of the class, undergraduates will be joined by a group of Stanford alumni and friends in a format called a Stanford &quot;Field Seminar.&quot; Because our class time on campus is limited to one week before travel, students will be required to complete all course readings over the summer. Both on campus and in South America, the course emphasizes student contributions and presentations. Students will be asked to lead discussions and carry out literature research on the conservation challenges of particular Patagonian protected areas and species. The final assignment for the seminar is to complete a seven- to ten-page paper on their findings and to present the main conclusions of that paper in a joint seminar of undergrads and alumni as we travel in Patagonia.  nnNote: Students will arrive on campus and will be housed at Stanford until we leave for Patagonia. The travel components of the course are organized and managed by the Travel/Study Program of the Stanford Alumni Association.  The costs of the trip (except incidentals) are included, thanks to the support of the Stanford Field Seminar Fund and generous donors.  Students will return to campus on Sunday, September 25, the day before the fall term begins. Sophomore College course, applications required. Submit by April 5, 2016 at http://soco.stanford.edu .
