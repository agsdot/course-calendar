LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:The 2016 presidential campaign will go down in history as a unique blend of personality and politics. But what actually happened behind-the-scenes remains a mystery to most. This course will introduce students to the nuts-and-bolts of a presidential campaign. Each week, we will explore a different topic related to running for the presidency -- policy formation, campaign finance laws and regulations, communications, grassroots strategy, and digital outreach -- and feature high-profile guest speakers who have served in senior roles on both Democratic and Republican campaigns. Students, guests, and faculty will also participate in discussions on how these topics will related to the 2016 presidential contest, and how they might apply to future presidential campaigns.  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, Final Paper.  Cross-listed with Public Policy (PUBLPOL 146, PUBLPOL 246) and Political Science (POLISCI 72).
