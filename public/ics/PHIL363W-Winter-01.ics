DESCRIPTION:This course is a discussion seminar for graduate students, focusing on work published since 2000. It hypothesizes that recent work on scientific realism does not respect the boundaries that were established by twentieth-century &quot;science wars.&quot; We will read philosophers of science who embrace metaphysics and some historicism; and we will read historians of science who condemn Lysenkoism and are realists about climate change. We will debate whether postmodern anthropological critique has been adopted by neoconservatives and &quot;run out of steam.&quot; And we will engage with ambitious projects to build a feminist realism that embraces modern physics. Students from all departments are welcome. Undergraduates admitted by instructor's permission.
