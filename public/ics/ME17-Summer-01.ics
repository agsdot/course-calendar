DESCRIPTION:This course is about what causes flames to look like they do and about what causes them to propagate.  The physical and chemical phenomena that govern behaviors of flames will constitute the topics for discussion.  The basic principles that govern flame phenomena include the conservation of mass, the first law of thermodynamics, and the momentum principle.  Since flame processes are controlled by the rates of chemical reactions, these basic principles will be applied when account is made for the chemical transformations that occur when reactant bonds are broken and new bonds are formed, producing combustion products.  In essence, this course serves as an introduction to combustion science.
