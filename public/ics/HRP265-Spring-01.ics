DESCRIPTION:The course will cover the area of network meta-analysis, a technique used to compare treatments that have not been compared directly to each other, but are included in a &quot;network&quot; of randomized trials that allows inferences to be made based on indirect comparisons. In traditional meta-analysis all included studies compare the same intervention with the same comparator. Network meta-analysis extends this concept by including multiple pair-wise comparisons across a range of interventions and provides estimates of relative treatment effects between all interventions in the network. This technique is being increasingly used in evidence-based medicine, health technology assessments and policy making.  nnRecommended preparation: HEP 206, and at least 2 quarters of biostatistics and one of epidemiology, including clinical research design. Familiarity with logistic and linear regression modeling required.
