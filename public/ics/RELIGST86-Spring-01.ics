DESCRIPTION:The New Testament is many things to many people.  Around the globe, it is and has been for two millennia a source of culture, law, and faith.  It has been used both to undergird battles for civil rights and to fight against them.  It has been used both to justify wars and to argue that all war is unjust.  Yet, many people haven&iquest;t read the New Testament and still more haven&iquest;t looked at it from historical, sociological, comparative and literary frameworks.  This course will provide you the opportunity to read the New Testament and to study it closely.  We will ask questions of the New Testament about the early Jesus movement, how it fits into its historical context and how it developed.  We will look at the range of opinions and views about Jesus present in this literature.  We will explore the different genres used by early Christians.  We will examine how this set of Early Christian texts came to be considered the canon.
