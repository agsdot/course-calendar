DESCRIPTION:In 2009 a student who was about to graduate said to me, &quot;Being coached at the GSB helped me grow over the last two years, but after I leave school and no longer have access to these resources, how will I continue to coach myself?&quot;nnThis course is an attempt to help you answer that question. I define self-coaching as the process of guiding our own growth and development, particularly through periods of transition, in both the professional and personal realms. In this course you'll explore a range of practices and disciplines intended to help you build on what you've learned about yourself over the last two years and continue that process after graduation.nnWhile this is a self-directed process, it's not a solitary one, and you'll work with classmates in pairs and small groups, so be prepared to discuss meaningful personal issues with your fellow students.nnClasses will consist of a mix of short lectures, exercises, small group discussions, and coaching conversations in pairs.nnBecause every class session involves extensive interaction with other students, missing a class would negatively affect those students' learning. As a result, students are obligated to attend each of the nine sessions in the course. An unexcused absence will lower your grade a full level, and more than one unexcused absence may result in a U. For students taking the class Pass/Fail, an unexcused absence may result in a failing grade.
