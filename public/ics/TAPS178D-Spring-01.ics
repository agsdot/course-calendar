DESCRIPTION:Instructor Young Jean Lee is a playwright and director who will have two plays premiering on Broadway in 2018-2019. To participate in this workshop, students must bring in a draft of a full length straight play for revision, which may have been written in part one of this course, WRITING A FULL-LENGTH PLAY. Students can participate in this class without having taken part one, as long as they have written a full length play they can work on. In conjunction with a variety of other editing techniques, students will focus on editing in collaboration with others. They will learn how to edit in response to hearing their plays read aloud; how to give and solicit the most useful kinds of feedback; how to cope with harsh criticism; what to do when people are offended by what they have written; how to know which notes to pay attention to and which notes to ignore; and how to let go of ideas and text that are not working. Other topics to be discussed: getting your work produced vs. self-producing; directing your own work vs. working with a director; and starting your own theater company. Students must contact the instructor at yjl@stanford.edu for permission to enroll in the course.
