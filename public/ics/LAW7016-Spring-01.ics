LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 784)  This course will consider one of the newest intellectual currents within American Legal Theory -- Critical Race Theory. Emerging during the 1980s, critical race scholars made many controversial claims about law and legal education -- among them that race and racial inequality suffused American law and society, that structural racial subordination remained endemic, and that both liberal and critical legal theories marginalized the voices of racial minorities. Course readings will be taken from both classic works of Critical Race Theory and newer interventions in the field, as well as scholarship criticizing or otherwise engaging with Critical Race Theory from outside or at the margins of the field.  Meeting dates:  The class will meet 7:15PM to 9:15PM on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday (April 11, 12, and 13), and the following Monday and Tuesday (April 17 and 18).  Elements used in grading: Class Participation, Written Assignments.
