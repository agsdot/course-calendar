DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 300)  Executives of American public companies control one of the largest accumulations of wealth in history, amounting to trillions of dollars in market capitalization.  Tens of billions of dollars of securities in these companies are traded daily.  This course addresses the most interesting and complex litigation that arises in connection with these securities, including fraud claims against executives and corporations, criminal actions for insider trading, internal investigations of executive misconduct, SEC enforcement actions, and derivative actions against corporate directors and officers.  This course does not concern stock market technicalities.  Instead, you will learn the basic legal framework governing this area, the theories underpinning it, and how to present legal arguments in this area.  You will learn in a group setting by working out solutions to some of the most challenging issues that we have faced.  In the process you will come to recognize the patterns we see and understand the forces behind them, so that you are prepared to practice in this area.  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, Class Participation, Exam.
