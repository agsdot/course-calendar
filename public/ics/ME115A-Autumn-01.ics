DESCRIPTION:An intensive project-based class that introduces the central philosophy of the product design program.  Students learn how to use the lens of human needs to innovate at the intersection of technical factors (feasibility), business factors (viability), and human values  (desirability). Students work toward mastery of the human-centered design methodology through several real-world, team-based projects.  Students gain fluency in designing solutions ranging from physical products, to digital interfaces, to services and experiences.  Students are immersed in building their individual and team capacities around core design process and methods, and emerge with a strong foundation in needfinding, synthesis, ideation, rapid prototyping, user testing, iteration, and storytelling.
