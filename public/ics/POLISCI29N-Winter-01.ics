DESCRIPTION:Today, almost one-third of Americans identify with a racial/ethnic minority group, and more than 9 million Americans identify with multiple races. What are the implications of such diversity for American politics and culture? In this course, we approach issues of race from an interdisciplinary perspective, employing research in the social sciences and humanities to assess how race shapes perceptions of identity as well as political behavior in 21st century U.S. We will examine issues surrounding the role of multiculturalism, immigration, acculturation, racial representation and racial prejudice in American society. Topics we will explore include the political and social formation of &quot;race&quot;; racial representation in the media, arts, and popular culture; the rise and decline of the &quot;one-drop rule&quot; and its effect on political and cultural attachments; the politicization of Census categories and the rise of the Multiracial Movement.
