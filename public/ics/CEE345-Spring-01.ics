DESCRIPTION:The objectives of this course are to: 1) introduce you to the mathematical theory of networks and common metrics of networks; 2) develop an understanding of how to utilize network models to study urban systems; 3) provide an opportunity to apply network models to analyze a real urban system.  Students are expected to have a strong background in calculus and linear algebra before taking this course and should be comfortable with the calculation and manipulation of matrices.  Experience in a numerical scripting language (preferably Python, R or Matlab) is necessary for the final project.  Coursework will consist of graded problem sets pertaining to both theory of networks and applications to urban systems.  There will be a final project where students will be required to apply network based methods to the analysis of real data of an urban system. (subject to change)
