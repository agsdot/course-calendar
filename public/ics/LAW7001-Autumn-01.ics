DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 238)  Administrative agencies interpret statutes, promulgate regulations, and adjudicate disputes, thereby affecting vast areas of life -- from employment to food and drug safety, from the environment to energy markets, and from telecommunications to immigration. This course surveys the law of the administrative state, considering rationales for delegation to administrative agencies, procedural and substantive constraints on agency decision-making, and the judicial review of agency actions. Elements used in grading: Class participation, attendance, assignments, final exam.  Attendance is required to retain a seat in class.  Special Instructions:  In 2016-2017 this class is open enrollment.  Subsequent to this year, enrollment will be limited by lottery, but no priority will be given to 3Ls.
