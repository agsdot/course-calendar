DESCRIPTION:This course introduces students to the major environmental aspects of oil and gas production, including law, policy, regulation, impact assessment, and mitigation. Through readings, lectures, homework, in-class activities, and case studies, students learn about the major state/federal laws and regulatory programs governing oil and gas in the U.S., industry permitting and compliance strategies, and current public stakeholder issues/challenges (with a particular focus on climate change and water management). Emerging legislative/regulatory trends, advocacy approaches, and sustainability concepts also are explored.
