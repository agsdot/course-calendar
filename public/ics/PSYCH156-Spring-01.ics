DESCRIPTION:Understanding the structure and function of the brain is presently an international goal with Brain Initiatives in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Due to this global interest, knowledge about the brain is influencing all aspects of society. As such, accurate communication and translation of neuroscience findings are of utmost importance. This course will examine ways to translate and to communicate neuroscience research for public outreach, with a focus on the role of technology. Topics include:  television, feature articles, blogs, documentaries, and online videos. Students will learn different ways to accurately translate and communicate neuroscience topics in the context of theoretical and methodological approaches and to apply these tools in an original way to generate a completed outreach piece by the end of the course.
