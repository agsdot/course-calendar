DESCRIPTION:We will discuss effective strategies for building diverse and inclusive companies, and will address the barriers that can often exist. We'll study approaches to organizational design that limit unconscious bias and produce more objective decisions across the employee experience - from attracting and hiring candidates to developing and retaining employees. Finally, we'll look at how to create inclusive cultures, with a specific focus on feedback, belonging, and 'Radical Candor&iquest;. The class will be taught by Fern Mandelbaum, Co-Founder and Managing Partner at Vista Venture Partners and Joelle Emerson, Founder and CEO of Paradigm. We will also hear from executives at companies that have successfully incorporated diversity and inclusion programs.
