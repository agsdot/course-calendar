DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 281)  Natural resource management presents extremely difficult and contentious issues of law and public policy.  Major debates continue to rage over issues such as the Endangered Species Act, whether the United States should permit drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and how to prevent the overfishing of the oceans.  This course will focus on two major aspects of natural-resource management: biodiversity protection (including the Endangered Species Act, ocean fisheries management, and global protection of marine mammals) and public lands in the United States such as national parks and wilderness areas.  The course also will examine the National Environmental Protection Act and the effectiveness of environmental impact assessments.  Class sessions will include critical examinations of current law and policy and in-depth discussions of situational case studies that force you to consider how you would resolve real-life issues.  Students will be expected to participate actively in class discussions.  (This course will not examine either water law or energy law in any depth.  Water Law will be offered again in the 2015-2016 academic year.  Several other courses in the Law School deal with energy-law questions.)  Elements used in grading: Class participation and final exam (open book).
