LOCATION:Econ 106
DESCRIPTION:This is part of a three course sequence (along with Econ 277 &amp; 278) on behavioral and experimental economics. The sequence has two main objectives:  1) examines theories and evidence related to the psychology of economic decision making,  2) Introduces methods of experimental economics, and explores major subject areas (including those not falling within behavioral economics) that have been addressed through laboratory experiments. Focuses on series of experiments that build on one another in an effort to test between competing theoretical frameworks, with the objects of improving the explanatory and predictive performance of standard models, and of providing a foundation for more reliable normative analyses of policy issues. Prerequisites: 204 and 271, or consent of instructor.
