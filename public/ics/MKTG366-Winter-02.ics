DESCRIPTION:This course is focused on advanced methods and approaches to marketing analytics. Firms often operate in an increasingly challenging environment, with greater competition, more informed customers and rapidly changing market trends. They also operate in a data-rich environment, with information often at the individual customer level. Knowing how to use this information to optimize business decisions is a competitive advantage.nnnThe course will take a hands-on approach to learning advanced techniques and methods in marketing analytics. The course will set a broad set of topics including pricing, advertising, channel management and customer relationship management amongst others. Students will use a mix of approaches including statistical methods, experimental and quasi-experimental approaches. This course will use a hybrid model, with a mix of case studies, exercises and flipped classrooms, where students will read/view material in advance of the class, with the class sessions focusing on discussing the topics at a deeper level. A major component of the course will be a project that students will work on in partnership with a firm on solving a business problem using the methods and approaches learned in this course.nnnThe course will be a good fit for students who have a background in advanced statistical methods and programming, or are willing to acquire these skills on their own in advance.
