DESCRIPTION:21st-century South Africa continues its literary effervescence. In this class we&iquest;ll sample some recent novels and related writings to tease out the issues shaping the country (and to some degree the continent) at present. Is `South African literature&iquest; a meaningful category today? What are the most significant features we can identify in new writings and how do they relate to contemporary social dynamics? The course will appeal to anyone interested in present-day Cape Town or Johannesburg, including students who have spent a term in BOSP-Cape Town or plan to do so in future. Both undergraduate and graduate students are welcome. 2-3 units. Course may be repeated for credit.n nAll students will write short analyses from the prescribed texts. Students taking the course for three units will write an extended essay on a topic agreed with the instructor.
