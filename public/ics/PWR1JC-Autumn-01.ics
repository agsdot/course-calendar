DESCRIPTION:The issue of reproduction provides a powerful rhetorical lens for looking critically and incisively into our own assumptions about race, gender, class, sexuality, power, rights, justice, &quot;nature,&quot; technology, and modernity. With an intention to challenge assumptions, we will explore issues through a variety of perspectives. For example, we will explore theoretical debates over the &quot;family&quot; and its viability as a vehicle for securing recognition and rights, place liberal feminist ideas like &quot;bodily autonomy&quot; in conversation with complicatedly contradictory concepts like natal endangerment or father's rights in abortion and family planning, investigate legal and medical histories of eugenics, sterilization abuse, and practices of coercive and disciplinary contraception, and analyze rhetoric associated with different forms of commodified reproduction, from black women's forced &quot;manufacture&quot; of slave labor to practices of transnational gestational surrogacy.

Enrollment is handled by the PWR office.
