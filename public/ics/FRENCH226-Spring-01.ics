DESCRIPTION:Moli&egrave;re's life and work as a point of departure for the notion of multiculturalism. Born in a bourgeois family, Moli&egrave;re was in contact with social milieux including the French peasantry for whom he wrote farces, and the court of Louis XIV for whom he provided spectacles at Versailles. Major plays, including Tartuffe, Le bourgeois gentilhomme, and Le malade imaginaire as the expression of the new court culture. Sociohistorical and contemporary literary approaches: Moli&egrave;re as the unifying artistic figure in a multicultural France. Taught in French.
