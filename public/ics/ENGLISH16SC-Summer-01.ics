LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:Who doesn't love going to a play: sitting in the darkened theater, an anonymous member of the audience waiting to be entertained, charmed, and challenged? But how many of us know enough about the details of the plays, their interpretation, their production, and acting itself, to allow us to appreciate fully the theatrical experience? In this seminar, we will spend 13 days in Ashland, Oregon, at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival (OSF), where we will attend these plays: Shakespeare's Hamlet, Richard II, The Winter's Tale, Timon of Athens, and Twelfth Night; the world premiere of Lisa Loomer's Roe; Qui Nguyen's Vietgone; William F. Brown and Charlie Smalls' The Wiz (adapted from L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz); the world premiere of Penny Metropulos and Linda Alpers' adaptation of Charles Dickens' Great Expectations, and a world premiere adaptation of Gilbert and Sullivan's The Yeomen of the Guard. (To read more about these productions, go to  www.osfashland.org). We will also spend time backstage, meeting with actors, designers, and artistic and administrative directors of OSF. Students will read the plays before the seminar begins. In Ashland, they will produce staged readings and design a final paper based on one of the productions. These reviews will be delivered to the group and turned in on Thursday, September 22. n  Note: This seminar will convene in Ashland on Monday, September 5, and will adjourn to Stanford on Sunday, September 18. Students must arrive in Ashland by 4:00 p.m. on September 5. Room and board in Ashland and transportation to Stanford will be provided and paid for by the program.
