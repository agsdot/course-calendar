DESCRIPTION:How can we make historical materials, social and cultural practices and extant sites accessible in the present day? In this course, students will have the opportunity to design and create an innovative digital project based on a medieval primary source. In the first part of the course, we will familiarize ourselves with medieval European cultural history, focusing on different kinds of sources, including historical and religious texts, narrative and music, architecture, images, objects, and textiles. Then we will examine and evaluate digital resources and approaches to medieval sources, including digital facsimiles, experiments with virtual spaces, and informational sites. In order to contemporize and vivify the medieval, an integral component of this course will be the California Missions, since they so dramatically represent a medieval modus operandi in a modern, and, for Stanford, local, world.
