DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 500)  The course is a survey of the theories of law and adjudication that have been most important in this country since the Civil War, concluding with an introduction to significant contemporary schools of legal thought. We will consider Formalist (Langdellian) Legal Science, Sociological Jurisprudence, American Legal Realism, the Legal Process School, Law and Moral Philosophy, Public Choice Theory, Law and Economics, Feminist Jurisprudence, Critical Race Theory, the Law and Society movement, and Empirical Legal Studies. The readings are drawn principally from primary materials -- the important contemporary manifestos and critiques of the schools of thought studied, along with writings that involve their application to concrete legal problems or reveal their influence on others. Enrollment allowing, students may be asked to help co-teach some of the sessions.  Contact Prof. Fried (bfried@stanford.edu) if you would like to look at a syllabus from prior years before deciding whether to enroll.  Special Instructions: If any student would like to write a research paper in lieu of the final exam, he or she should consult the instructor before the start of the course. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) (Final exam option) into section (02) (Final paper option) with consent of the instructor.  Section (02) meets the R requirement.  Elements used in grading: Class Participation plus Final Exam or Final Paper.
