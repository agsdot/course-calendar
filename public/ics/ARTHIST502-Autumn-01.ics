DESCRIPTION:This seminar explores why and how art historians use description. Focusing on famous instances such as Homer's description of the shield of Achilles in The Iliad the course examines how certain art historians practice and theorize this most fundamental skill. Not limiting itself to art history proper, the course also considers how novelists and poets use description, and how fiction-writing and poetry might be vital models for the art historian.  Above all, we look with emulation and envy at novelists and poets powers of imagistic writing. The course is a workshop devoted to particular techniques and problems of descriptive writing, with the hope that all the examples we study (from poetry to fiction to art history itself) can intensify students own powers of description.
