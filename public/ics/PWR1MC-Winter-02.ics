DESCRIPTION:In 2010, the University of Michigan hosted an international conference entitled &quot;Against Health,&quot; which questioned how health has become a moralizing system dictating how people should behave and make decisions. In 2014, the Whitney Biennial selected Jackie Wang's anti-racist essay &quot;Against Innocence&quot; to be sold as part of their elite art exhibition. But how can one be &quot;against health&quot; or &quot;against innocence&quot;? These titles pose riddles for their readers. They use a strategy of oppositional rhetoric to challenge foundational assumptions in provocative ways. How can we as writers contend with the challenges at the heart of such rhetoric? For a full course description, see https://vcapwr-catalog.stanford.edu. For more information about PWR 1, see https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/pwr/courses/pwr-1. Enrollment is handled by the PWR office.
