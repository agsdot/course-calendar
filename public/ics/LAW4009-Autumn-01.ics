DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 796)  Patentable goods and services are increasingly important in today's global information economy, and they frequently cross national borders, physically or electronically. This course will include a comparative examination of the major national patent systems, a survey of the principal international patent treaties, and discussions of related transnational patent issues. We will examine these topics both from the perspective of global patent practitioners -- who face challenges such as securing large international patent portfolios and strategizing multinational patent litigation -- and from the perspective of the academics and policymakers who are engaged in ongoing patent harmonization debates. Each student will also write and present an independent research paper. Prerequisites: Introduction to Intellectual Property or consent of instructor. Elements used in grading: Class Participation, Attendance, Final Paper.
