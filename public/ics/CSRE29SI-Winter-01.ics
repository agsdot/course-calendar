DESCRIPTION:We will begin the course by analyzing the history of immigration politics and policy in the United States. How did immigrants fit into and complicate the constructed racial hierarchy throughout history? What characterized the waves of migration to the United States? How have undocumented been marginalized, and what are the ways in which the community responded? In looking at this history, we will learn about the effects it has had on the immigrant community as it relates to the long-lasting disparate impacts in education, criminal justice, and political representation. nnImmigrants make up a profoundly diverse community that is often mischaracterized. We will discuss the varying perceptions of immigrants today and how they impact attitudes and current policies. Although the course and the trip are designed with a focus on national immigration policy, we will also spend some time in this course narrowing in and using the Bay Area as a case study
