DESCRIPTION:Design Garage is a Winter/Spring class (a two quarter commitment is required).  The class is a deep dive in design thinking that uses student-led projects to teach design process and methods.  The projects come from investigations conducted during the Fall quarter where the preliminary need finding, customer research, and product or service ideas have been developed to provide the seed projects for the student design teams.  Students will learn the methodologies of design thinking by bringing a product, service, or experience to market.  Students apply to Design Garage in the Fall, and teams are formed after interviews and applications are reviewed. Prerequisite: graduate student standing.
