LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:This Arts Intensive (September) course meets in the Los Angeles region as a Arts Intensive, course with an option for a follow up directed reading in Autumn Qtr 2017.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In September students begin in Los Angeles for an immersion into the region wide exhibition: Pacific Standard Time LA/LA with the guidance of two professors at UCLA's Chicano Research Center. The Arts Intensive course will engage with the exhibition through multiple venues and museums participating in Pacific Standard Time. Shows we will see range from visual and installation works, photography, performance and street art. Professors&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chicano.ucla.edu/about/director&quot;&gt; Chon A. Noriega&lt;/a&gt; (UCLA Dept. of Theater, Film and Television) and Charlene Villasenor Black (UCLA Dept. of Art History) will give lectures and guide students exploring the of two specific shows they curated: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lacma.org/art/exhibition/home-so-different-so-appealing&quot;&gt;HOME at LACMA&lt;/a&gt; and a photo exhibit at the Gene Autry Museum. These are among two of the projects that students will explore as well as other offerings in the collective PST.  Upon the return to Stanford students have the option to enroll in directed reading and design their own curatorial projects: visual or performance works that explore the overall themes of LA/LA and gain guidance in mounting those projects on campus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More about PST: Through a series of thematically linked exhibitions, Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA will present a wide variety of important works of art, much of them new to Southern California audiences. While the majority of exhibitions will have an emphasis on modern and contemporary art, there also will be crucial exhibitions about the ancient world and the pre-modern era. With topics such as luxury objects in the pre-Columbian Americas, 20th-century Afro-Brazilian art, alternative spaces in Mexico City, and boundary-crossing practices of Latino artists, exhibitions will range from monographic studies of individual artists to broad surveys that cut across numerous countries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the exhibitions will focus on the visual arts, Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA programs will ultimately expand to touch on music, performance, literature, and even cuisine. Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA will be a multifaceted event that will transform Los Angeles and Southern California for five months, and our understanding of modern and contemporary art forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Embracing organizations of all sizes and types &iquest;from the largest museums to smaller museums, from university galleries to performing arts centers&iquest;Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA exhibitions and programs will take place across Southern California, from Santa Barbara to San Diego, from Santa Monica to Palm Springs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With its historical roots in Latin America and its current demographics, Los Angeles might be described as tomorrow's capital city. In a way that is possible only in Los Angeles, Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA will implicitly raise complex and provocative issues about present-day relations throughout the Americas and the rapidly changing social and cultural fabric of Southern California.
