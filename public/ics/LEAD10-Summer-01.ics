LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:Strengthen your leadership skills in one of Stanford&iquest;s only purely experiential learning opportunities. Leadership Intensive offers rising juniors a unique and immersive practice of leadership through a 3-week residential summer program just before the start of fall quarter. Leadership Intensive is characterized by, as the name implies, intense exploration of your own leadership skills and abilities (courage required). Design thinking, diverse teams and hands-on practice are integral components of the program. The first two weeks take place on campus, while the last week happens off-site (and mostly outdoors) in the greater Bay Area.
