DESCRIPTION:Artificial intelligence has entered nearly every facet of our society. This course intends to give students, particularly non-CS majors, a fundamental understanding of AI and its implications for art, ethics, philosophy, and human consciousness. By drawing upon a variety of sources, holding hands-on workshops, and incorporating field trips, we hope to explore the interdisciplinary issues raised by AI progress that society must wrestle with in the near future. Enrollment is limited to 20 students. The application is available at http://bit.ly/explore-ai and due at 11.59pm on the first day of classes 03/30/2016.
