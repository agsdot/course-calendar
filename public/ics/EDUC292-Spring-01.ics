DESCRIPTION:Students will acquire helpful writing strategies, habits, and critical faculties; increase their sense of writing as revision; and leave them with resources that will support them in their own lifelong pursuit of good writing. Students will work on revising their own papers and editing papers of other students. Class will focus on exercises in a variety of critical writing skills: framing, concision, clarity, emphasis, rhythm, action, actors, argument, data, quotations, and usage. Course enrollment limited to graduate students.
