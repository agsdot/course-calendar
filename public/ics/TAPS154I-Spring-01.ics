DESCRIPTION:Throughout the twentieth century and into the present day, musicals have sought to tell stories about a broad range of American experiences and engage with complex social issues. Foremost among these themes are the topics of race and cultural appropriation, immigration and citizenship, and LGBT lives and queer identity. Even as they seek to represent diverse perspectives and facilitate progressive social change, musicals just as often can reinforce and replicate troubling conceptions surrounding gender, race, sexual identity. This course will examine works of musical theater from the 1920s to the present day in order to understand how each of these individual works, and the musical as a genre and institution, navigates this forward-and-backward tension surrounding these three topics. Our focus will be on commercially successful stage and screen musicals that cover the span of almost a hundred years, from The Jazz Singer (1927) to Hamilton (2015). In the course of lectures and discussions we will build a working vocabulary for analyzing the musical's salient components including music and lyrics, staging, libretto, choreography, and cinematography and engage with key scholarship from musicology, performance studies, film studies, and American studies. The final week of class will examine current and planned musical theater productions on campus using the tools and perspectives from the previous three parts.
