DESCRIPTION:Do science and technology have cultures? Or, being factual and technical, are they beyond cultural analysis? Modern science and technology are some of the defining features of the contemporary world, but they often resist being understood in their social and cultural contexts. This class introduces students to key theoretical approaches in the social study of science alongside recent ethnographic studies. The class will cover concepts like objectivity, boundary-work, materiality, and indigenous knowledge. We will also analyze the design, use, and repair of technologies, as well as the politics folded into them. We will look at medical science and technology, including assumptions about race, class, and health disparities. By the end of the course, students will learn to see science, technology, and medicine as social and cultural products that can be analyzed with anthropological research methods.
