DESCRIPTION:This course will focus on recent work on the nature of normativity and normative disagreements. Issues to be discussed include the following: a) naturalism vs. non-naturalism about normativity, b) the relationship between different kinds of normativity (for example: the rules of board games vs. moral norms), c) the nature of normative disagreements (and how thinking about this might help us make progress in normative inquiry), and d) the relationship between meta-normative theory and substantive normative inquiry. Our focus will be on discussing these issues as they arise in the context of ethics and metaethics, but we will also engage with connected work in the philosophy of law and epistemology. We will read work from Sharon Street, Allan Gibbard, Tristram McPherson, Stephanie Leary, Ralph Wedgwood, Selim Berker, Errol Lord, Christine Korsgaard, Scott Shapiro, Ronald Dworkin, and David Enoch, among others.The seminar will involve visits from some of the philosophers whose work we will be reading. Prerequisite: graduate student in philosophy, or permission of instructor.
