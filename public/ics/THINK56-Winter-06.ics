DESCRIPTION:Is there a right to a basic level of health care?  How should these resources be allocated? More globally, are there limits to how much should be spent on health care? If so, how should health care be distributed? One of the places where resource constraints are controversial and significant is in the field of health care, where lives literally hang in the balance of the decisions we make.  In this course, we will develop the tools needed to begin to address these questions in a systematic way. Students will be introduced to general theoretical approaches to justice and ethics to provide a framework for evaluating particular topics. Most of the readings will refer back to these approaches as they are applied to particular issues.  We will address justice and allocation issues at three different levels. First, we will discuss macro-level issues of health policy. This will include introducing students to basic concepts from health economics. What makes this course unique is that the bulk of the course will be applying these concepts at the institutional and bedside level.  Class lectures will provide real world examples where these issues arise. Students will be asked to actively engage in the topics and to place themselves in the positions where these decisions have to be made.
