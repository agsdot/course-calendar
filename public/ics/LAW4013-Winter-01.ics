DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 755)  Today almost all modern businesses need advice about information privacy law. While the roots of privacy law in the US started with a right to be let alone, modern business models, the needs of the administrative state, law enforcement priorities, and our own behavior complicate approaches based solely upon seclusion or secrecy. This course will explore the roots of US privacy law, its evolution in the 20th century, and the challenges of regulating information in the modern era where institutions and individuals need and reveal information constantly, but also seek basic dignity and safety from harm. Privacy law is comprised of torts, contracts, constitutional law, statutory law, soft law norms, and emerging technologies. We will discuss all of these things, as well as incorporate developments in the news.  Elements used in grading:  Final Exam.
