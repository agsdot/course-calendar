DESCRIPTION:This seminar will examine the tension in American foreign policy between pursuing U.S. security and economic interests and promoting American values abroad.  The course will retrace the theoretical and ideological debates about values versus interests, with a particular focus on realism versus liberalism.  The course will examine the evolution of these debates over time, starting with the French revolution, but with special attention given to the Cold War, American foreign policy after September 11th, and the Obama administration.  The course also will examine how these contending theories and ideologies are mediated through the U.S. bureaucracy that shapes the making of foreign policy. ** NOTE:  All interested students should attend the first class. Final enrollment criteria will be detailed on the first day of class. There will be 16 spaces available in the course.
