DESCRIPTION:Spring Awakening The MusicalnOct. 27-29 &amp; Nov. 3-5, 2016 nnA Production of TAPS Department in collaboration with Arts Intensive: The Next Stage Premier Performance in brand new Roble Gym Theater! Auditions in April, TBA. nExecutive Produced by Professor and Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education, Harry J. Elam, Jr. Based on Frank Wedekind's controversial 1891 play of the same name, Spring Awakening is an electrifying contemporary musical with a pop/rock score and a rebellious spirit. Winner of 8 Tony Awards, the musical follows the interweaving lives of a group of adolescents as they navigate issues of sexuality, morality, and adulthood. With book and lyrics by Steven Sater and music by Duncan Sheik, Spring Awakening is a touching expose of lost innocence and coming of age. nnThis production serves as the launching pad into Stanford's next theatrical evolution, as both the first production in the new Roble Gym Theater and the inaugural event for Arts Intensive: The Next Stage.nnStudents will be cast through the audition process in April 2016.  Cast members and other key creative roles will be offered 2 units credit through the Arts Intensive program and will be housed on campus for rehearsals during the Arts Intensive program period:  September 5-16, 2016.  (Students with an Autumn Housing Assignment will move to their assigned residence on Sept. 16th).
