DESCRIPTION:What can power lines, water pipes, and fibre optic cables tell us about how different groups of people navigate life in global cities?  While such infrastructures are often considered to be the mere &quot;background&quot; of socio-cultural life in cities, this course will center on them and their rhetorical contexts in order to explore how opportunity and inequality are imagined and discussed in urban spaces. We will contemplate how knowledge, relations of power, and practices of governance work within the framework of deep rhetorical analysis of urban infrastructures.

Enrollment is handled by the PWR office.
