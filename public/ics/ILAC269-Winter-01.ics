LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:This course will focus on the &quot;Beautiful game&quot; including the humor and the emotion of scoring and winning the soccer games. We will show some documentaries as the short &quot;Bagdah Messi&quot; about a 9 year old goalie from Iraq who jumps on his only leg as a way of playing soccer, and whom his friends dismiss from the team because of the goals he cannot stop. And the wonderful feature film &quot;Pelada&quot; about a couple of American footballers, 20 years old each, from Uni of Notre Dame, who travel to 25 countries all over the world (Francia, Iran, Israel, Spain, Argentina, Uruguay among others), on foot (without the traditional football shoes) because they are passionate about the &quot;beautiful game.&quot; We will also read the book &quot;Finding the game&quot; by Gwendolyn Oxenham (the female of the couple) who will tell us their unique experience. Other films in this course: &quot;Bar&ccedil;a Dreams,&quot; &quot;Soccer City&quot; about soccer in South Africa, &quot;Maradona&quot; by Emir Kusturica, &quot;Messi&quot; by &Aacute;lex de la Iglesia, &quot;Isto &eacute; Pel&eacute;,&quot; &quot;Lesbianas de Buenos Aires,&quot; &quot;Melegol&quot; (animation), and so forth.
