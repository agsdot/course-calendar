LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:As children, we all possessed an innate understanding of the power of laughter, and most believed ourselves to be not just skilled in the craft of comedy, but uproariously funny. As we grew up, however, and particularly as we entered the world of business, something changed. Studies show that babies laugh on average 400 times a day, whereas adults average only 15 - a number that decreases significantly on week days. Clearly, business is a serious endeavor. But perhaps it shouldn't be. This course is founded on a deep and scientifically supported belief in the power of humor in business. We will illuminate this belief by first building a bridge between the behavioral science of humor and laughter, illuminating the positive (and negative) consequences of creating a culture of levity. Then we'll explore the bottom line impact of such cultures on business, by revealing research into what makes people laugh from the living room to the board room to the oval office, by providing tools to help students harness humor safely and effectively in business, and finally, by exploring personal and cultural shifts for creating lasting systemic change. Oh. And we'll have a ton of fun along the way. Throughout the course, students will practice engaging a mindset of levity, honing the practice of humor, and using humor toward positive change on an individual, organizational, and global scale. Because in today's world more than ever, humor is serious business.
