DESCRIPTION:Continuation of CHINLANG 19. This is the third of the 3-course series on intermediate Cantonese.  The primary objective of the intermediate series is to help students acquire the vocabulary: (a) to engage in conversations about less concrete topics, (b) to give directions and instructions, and (c) to carry out transactions in linguistically unfamiliar situations.  Students will work on more complex grammar that allows them to express their ideas in a variety of sentence structures.  Authentic materials such as Cantopop, movies, and news clips are incorporated in the courses and Internet tools are used to enhance learning.  There is also an optional field trip to a karaoke bar, a dim sum restaurant, or a Cantonese community every quarter to experience Cantonese culture. Prerequisite: &quot;Cantonese Proficiency Tests&quot; on Coursework, CHINLANG 19.
