DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 278)  The contemporary debate over the proper role of a federal judge under the Constitution turns, in large measure, on what it is we think an Article III judge is doing when she is called upon to resolve a &quot;case or controversy.&quot; Is she looking for the fair result? If so, by whose lights? Is she a political actor, or is she instead looking for a rule of decision that has been previously established by law (a &quot;mere translator&quot; of the law, in Justice Frankfurter's words). If so, by natural law or positive law? These are some of the questions we will consider in discussing what role a federal judge plays when she exercises &quot;the judicial Power of the United States&quot; conferred by Article III of the Constitution. Readings will include books and articles by some of the leading legal thinkers in the nation's history.  Special Instructions: This class will meet the first three weeks of the quarter only.  Elements used in grading:  Class attendance and participation, reading the assigned material, and a 10-15 page paper that uses the readings to analyze a significant judicial opinion.  Special Instructions:  This class will meet the first three weeks of the quarter only.
