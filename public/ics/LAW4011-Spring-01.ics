DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 753)  This course covers the fundamentals of the law and practice of licensing of patents and technology.  Licensing is the principal means by which rights in patents and technology are shared, exploited and monetized.  It is fundamental to business models throughout the technology industry and beyond, including in software, mobile, consumer devices, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.  We cover (1) the business drivers and models for licensing patents and technology, (2) the core concepts and current trends of licensing law (both Federal Circuit and Supreme Court), and (3) key issues in structuring, drafting and negotiating patent and technology licenses.  We will emphasize the practical aspects of licensing patents and technology, and licensing in its broader context in relation to corporate, litigation, intellectual property and antitrust practices.  Elements used in grading:  Class Participation, Final Exam.
