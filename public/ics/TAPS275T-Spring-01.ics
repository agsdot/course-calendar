DESCRIPTION:Instructor Young Jean Lee is a playwright and director who will have two plays premiering on Broadway in 2018-2019. In this workshop, students will collaborate with her on developing a new play that she is writing for Steppenwolf Theatre. The students will explore the story through the use of improvisation, interviews, conversations, and source materials such as books, films, and music. This class will teach students the basics of starting a play, the process of theatrical collaboration, directing your own work, and the tools of devised ensemble work. Students will be required to read aloud and move around to work on staging, but acting and theater experience are not required.
