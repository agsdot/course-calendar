DESCRIPTION:In this course, we explore the growing interconnections between health and security. Global health can no longer be addressed without some important consideration of international security as war, civil conflict and political instability have increasingly defined the health challenges in major parts of the world. This course will address the interaction of three types of security: human, national, and international. Health is obviously a component of human security. However, it has also been raised as a concern of national and international security, particularly in areas where HIV/AIDS and Ebola have been prevalent and where the risk of pandemic outbreaks is high. This course will bring together a cross-disciplinary examination of these issues and address the opportunities and potential risks of tightly linking the provision of essential health services to security considerations. We will use case studies to explore both the conceptual and technical issues inherent in health and security. The challenges of Ebola, HIV, complex humanitarian emergencies, and pandemics will be explored in detail. As part of each discussion, the intense interaction of biology, service delivery, political legitimacy, human rights, and international relations will be examined. Upper division course with preference given to upperclassmen.
