DESCRIPTION:In this class we will explore the how and why of humor through readings, classroom discussion, rhetorical analysis, and, most importantly, through writing, and examine the ways that humor, as a rhetorical tool, is deployed in written and oral texts. As we consider theories of humor, we will begin to understand how humor works and why it is so powerful. For full course descriptions, see https://vcapwr-catalog.stanford.edu.
