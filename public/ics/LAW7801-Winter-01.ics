DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 519) This course will help students to develop the professional management skills that are essential for a successful legal career. The course will focus on team dynamics and leadership; effectively communicating with clients, colleagues, other parties and tribunals; client development and service; managing expectations and unexpected adversity; and the economics of law practice, including forecasting demand for legal services and project management. For the final paper, students will create a comprehensive, personal plan outlining the substantive knowledge, professional skills, and business focus they need to build a fulfilling law practice. Assignments and simulations will demonstrate and model various skills and instructors will provide real-time feedback to students on class exercises. The course is not limited to any particular type of practice (size or substantive area).  Elements used in grading: Class participation and attendance, course exercises and written assignments.
