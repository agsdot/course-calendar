DESCRIPTION:Prerequisite: PWR 1. Architecture is always the solution to a problem: Where am I going to sleep? What am I going to do with my dead? Where can I speak to my gods? In this sense, the structure, siting, materials and lighting that inhere in a work of architecture are direct responses to a lived problem. In this way, our class will draw on the rhetoric of architecture to illuminate the rhetoric of communication; we will do this under the premise that understanding the one can lead to a better understanding and practice of the other. For more information about PWR 2, see https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/pwr/courses/pwr-2. For full course descriptions, see https://vcapwr-catalog.stanford.edu. Enrollment is handled by the PWR office.
