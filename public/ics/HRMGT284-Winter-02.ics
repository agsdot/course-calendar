DESCRIPTION:HRMGT 284 will focus on the organization strategy of the firm. The success of a firm depends not just on a well-designed product market strategy, but on how well that strategy is executed to align the goals of the employees with those of the firm. Topics covered include meeting strategic objectives, hiring, pay, training, teamwork, promotions, performance evaluation, pay for top executives, management practices in startups, and organizational transformation. While the general theme is the management of the firm, the topics also lend themselves to developing perspectives on how you manage your personal career.
