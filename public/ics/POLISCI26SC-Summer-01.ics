DESCRIPTION:This seminar will study and examine the varied environmental and resource challenges facing Indian reservations in the western United States.  Over 360 Indian reservations, the majority of which are in the western United States, encompass over 56 million acres - a land total approximating the size of the State of Idaho  While Indian treaties and executive orders often relegated tribes to isolated and unwanted lands, Indian reservations frequently contain valuable natural resources such as oil, gas, hard minerals, and forests.  Many Indian tribes, moreover, enjoy special fishing rights and the legal right to vast amounts of water.  At the same time, Indian reservations face serious environmental challenges, including water contamination, habitat decline, and climate change.  To examine these questions, we will start with a week of classroom study and discussion.  During this week, we will examine the nature of the environmental and resource challenges facing Native American tribes today, the relevant ins and outs of federal Indian law and the legal rights of tribes, Native American governmental systems, and the approaches that tribes are currently taking to these challenges.  We will then move into the field and spend approximately ten days in the states of Washington, Montana, and Wyoming, meeting with tribal officials and seeing firsthand the environmental and resource challenges that they face.  On our return to Stanford, students will break into groups, and each group will analyze a particular challenge facing a Native American tribe and how best to address that challenge.  The course will culminate in student presentations on these analyses.  Over the summer, students also will be responsible for assigned readings, online interactive materials, and relevant recent news articles.  The class begins on-campus and then travels to Washington, Montana, and Wyoming. Travel expenses during the course will be provided (except incidentals) by the Bill Lane Center for the American West and Sophomore College.  Application required, due noon, April 5, 2016. Apply at http://soco.stanford.edu.  Cross-listed with Earth Systems (EARTHSYS 15SC), Native American Studies (NATIVEAM 15SC) and Political Science (POLISCI 26SC).
