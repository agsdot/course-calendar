DESCRIPTION:Prerequisite: PWR 1. Drawing from academic articles, newspaper and magazine stories, social media, television, and film, we will examine rhetoric in moments like the Rio Olympics to bring to the forefront the privilege that lies beneath. We will analyze various forms of privilege and their intersections, from race and gender to socioeconomic class, sexual orientation, citizenship, physical ability, and so on. We will also scrutinize our own privilege as part of the Stanford community. For more information about PWR 2, see https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/pwr/courses/pwr-2. For full course descriptions, see https://vcapwr-catalog.stanford.edu. Enrollment is handled by the PWR office.
