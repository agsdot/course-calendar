DESCRIPTION:This seminar will explore theoretical, empirical, and practical approaches to groups that come together around a common purpose or interest.  Emphasis is on democratically structured, non-hierarchical and non-institutional decision making, e.g. by grassroots activists, student, or neighborhood organizations.  Parliamentary, consensus, and informal procedures.  How do groups form?  How do they deliberate and make decision? What are the principles underlying different models for group process, and how well do different procedures work in practice? How do culture and identity affect the working of a group? And how are social technologies used? Readings from different disciplines and perspectives. Course is limited to 20 students. Prerequisite:  A course in social psychology, decision making or group sociology.
