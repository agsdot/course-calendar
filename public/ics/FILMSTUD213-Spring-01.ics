LOCATION:McMurtry Building rm 115
DESCRIPTION:Often derided in common parlance for being over the top, put down as weepies, tear-jerkers, and women's films, melodrama as a genre and a cinematic mode has been reclaimed by feminist and film scholars as providing a powerful site of ideological struggle. In this course, we will develop a historical and theoretical framework to examine how this popular dramatic mode, centered around the family, the home, and personal relationships affords radical critiques of and insights into discourses of gender, sexuality, race, class, and nation. We will consider the politics and aesthetics of adopting or rejecting the melodramatic mode in the films of Sirk, Ghatak, Bresson, Fassbinder, Akerman, Kiarostami, Almodovar, Haynes, among others.
