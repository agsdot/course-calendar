LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:Introduction to modernism through a survey of its major writers and the world in which they wrote. We will look at poets like T.S. Eliot and Gertrude Stein who changed the language, prose-writers like James Joyce and Ernest Hemingway who changed the story, painters like Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse who changed the view, and populists like Louis Armstrong and Charlie Chaplin who changed the scene. Along the way we will think about the basic questions of modernism: Who was involved? How did they interact? And perhaps most importantly, what features make their work modernist? With brief but lively introductions to this world, students will gain entry into academic habits of mind through authors and artists they already love.
