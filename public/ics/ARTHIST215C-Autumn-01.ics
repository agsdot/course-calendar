DESCRIPTION:This course focuses on the production, criticism, and curating of contemporary art. Through a series of required readings, intensive class discussions, class trips, and first-hand encounters with art objects and exhibitions, we will investigate current understandings of contemporary art.  We will also consider the history of contemporary art by looking at how art of the past was understood in its own moment, when it was new and now.
