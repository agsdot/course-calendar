DESCRIPTION:Prerequisite: PWR 1. In this writing and speaking course, you'll consider the construction and negotiation of power and difference through language as it intersects with gender, sexuality, race, ability, and class. We'll explore how this happens across spheres such as politics, education, science, sports and the media, intertwined with forces like globalization, immigration, and technology. For more information about PWR 2, see https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/pwr/courses/pwr-2. For full course descriptions, see https://vcapwr-catalog.stanford.edu. Enrollment is handled by the PWR office.
