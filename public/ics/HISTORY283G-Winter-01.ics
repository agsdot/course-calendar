DESCRIPTION:Prerequisite: Reading ability in Ottoman-Turkish and/or Arabic.  This course explores how women and men in the early modern Ottoman world (16th to 18th centuries) imagined their physical and spiritual environment, their past and future, their immediate places and far geographies, life and afterlife. The theoretical framework of discussions will be heavily based on Henri Lefebvre's  Production of Space and primary readings include various texts in Ottoman-Turkish, such as The Descriptions of Places of Matrak&ccedil; Nasuh (d.1564) and The Travels of Eviya &Ccedil;elebi (d.1682). We will also examine the Ottoman-Turkish manuscripts in Green Library.
