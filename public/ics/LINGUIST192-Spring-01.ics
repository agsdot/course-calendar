DESCRIPTION:Performance with language (speaking, reading, writing, listening, translating or interpreting) is used to measure a person's proficiency or achievement level in the language. Language performance is also used to measure other human characteristics, including psycho-social states and traits. The course will review basic methods in language measurement and cover their use as applied in education, psychology, and commerce.  Topics include both traditional and automatic methods for assessing speaking, reading, writing, affect, and language disorders.  Students will develop, apply, and evaluate a language test.
