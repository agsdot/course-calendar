LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 650) Advanced Negotiation courses are designed to take students beyond the two-party, lawyer-client negotiations that were the focus of the Negotiation Seminar, to examine many facets of negotiation complexity, both in terms of the participants and topics. This section of Advanced Negotiation will focus on multi-party negotiations, working in teams, group decision-making, and negotiating on behalf of organizations to solve complex problems, specifically when there are divided communities. We will study negotiations and stakeholder dialogue processes involving a diverse set of public and private actors. In the context of both real and simulated case studies, we will address diverse public policy issues, including civil rights, racial justice, economic inequality and natural resources management. Civil unrest as experienced recently in police-community conflicts -- such as Ferguson and Baltimore as well as in the Occupy Movement  -- increase polarization among groups of residents in ways not seen in decades.  The unrest sometimes produces positive results.  In many instances, participants experience the divisions as intense and pervasive, yet remain optimistic that they can be resolved.  These deep divisions pose significant challenges to the integrity of our democratic society and can quickly escalate to bitter contests, leaving fissures within communities for decades, and possibly resulting in major economic damage and even loss of life. The goals of the class are twofold, for students (1) to acquire an added theoretical base beyond what was covered in the Negotiation Seminar through which to analyze, prepare for, participate in and facilitate more complex, multiparty negotiations, and (2) to expand skills through deeper examination of various actual negotiation cases and complex simulations. Special Instructions: Attendance at and participation in the simulations is required. Passing is dependent upon active participation, submission of several assigned short reflection papers, and completion of a substantial group paper and presentation analyzing a selected case (a completed or ongoing multi-party public policy dialogue) and the team's internal negotiation process. Prerequisite: Negotiation Seminar (Law 615) or its substantial equivalent. Advanced degree students (and graduate students in other departments and programs) are encouraged to enroll provided that they have previous negotiation training or equivalent practice experience. After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor. Students approved for &quot;R&quot; credit will be graded on the H/P/R/F system. Elements used in grading: Class participation and engagement, including simulations; attendance; preparation for and contributions to discussion; short written assignments; final project involving group and individual components.
