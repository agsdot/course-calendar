DESCRIPTION:How is selfhood conceptualized in the ancient world and what is the contribution of lyric genres in shaping notions of the &iquest;self &iquest;? An approach to these questions will be enabled by intensive reading in theories about both ancient and modern lyric. Ancient lyric poetry of both the archaic and the classical period will regularly be juxtaposed with modern and modernist lyricism. Some philosophical writings, especially Plato, will also be included. Pairing with Part I in the Winter is recommended for classicists but optional.
