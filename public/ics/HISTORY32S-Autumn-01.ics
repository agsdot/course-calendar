DESCRIPTION:How did medicine emerge as a distinctive body of knowledge? Why did physicians, rather than other medical practitioners, come to dominate medicine? What was the role of women in medicine? How did law and medicine, two areas that have so many points of intersection in today&iquest;s world, interact in early modern society? This course investigates the history of medicine in Renaissance and early modern Europe. With its emphasis on primary sources, the course provides an introduction to medical and legal historical research.  Priority given to history majors and minors.
