LOCATION:Alway Building, Room M112
DESCRIPTION:This course will introduce two lung diseases, pulmonary hypertension and emphysema, and uses them as a forum to discuss how modern molecular and cellular analysis tools can offer novel insights into the mechanisms through which diseases arise.  We will discuss the histological and molecular processes underlying these diseases, and how modern techniques and approaches such as progenitor cell identification and lineage tracing, single cell RNA sequencing, deep tissue imaging, and cell type-specific mutation and misexpression can be employed to bring novel insights into their pathobiology and thereby offer potential opportunities to influence the course of these diseases. /
