DESCRIPTION:Data and Decisions is a first-year MBA course in statistics and regression analysis. The accelerated D&amp;D lab-based pilot is a new version of the course that combines extensive online materials with a more lab-based classroom approach. Traditional lecture content will be learned through online videos, simulations, and exercises, while time spent in the classroom will be discussions or computer lab sessions.  Content covered includes sampling techniques, hypothesis testing, t-tests, linear regression, and prediction models. The group regression project is a key component of the course, and all students will learn the software R. nThe accelerated course is designed for students with strong quantitative backgrounds. Students taking this course need to be comfortable with mathematical notation, algebra, and some calculus. Students without quantitative backgrounds should consider enrolling in the base version of the course.
