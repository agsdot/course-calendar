DESCRIPTION:How to design in car interfaces that take into account the emotional state of the driver in the moment of driving? Participants will be prototyping and testing interfaces for an industry partner. The challenge is to take real time responsive data to infer the emotional state of a driver and to lever these to improve the driving experience. We will cover topics on design methodology, psychology of emotions, and human machine interaction to reflect and work on the emotionally charged car experience of today to imagine the car of tomorrow. Class meetings will include: prototyping, discussions and presentations. Participants will have access to tools, prototyping materials, and a car. Students from all ENG majors but also beyond are encouraged to join. Bring your drivers license, if you have one. May be repeat for credit.
