LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:This intermediate/advanced dance technique class is grounded in the technical training, aesthetic sensibilities, and choreographic processes of Merce Cunningham, American dancer/master choreographer. This studio work at an intermediate/advanced level will build technical strength, speed, line, and rhythmic acuity/musicality and amplitude in dancing. The class will provides solid technical training useful and applicable to other forms of dancing. Dancers must be ready to work at an intermediate/advanced level to enroll. Studio practice will be supplemented by readings, video viewing, concert attendance, and participation in special workshops with guest artists. Though Cunningham-based dance technique is particularly well-suited to dancers with prior training in ballet, dancers with prior training in all forms of dance are welcome and strongly encouraged to enroll.  May be repeated for credit.
