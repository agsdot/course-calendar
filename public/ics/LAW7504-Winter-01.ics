DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 327)  Why do firms exist? Is their sustained success in markets possible? How do leaders choose and execute on a strategy? What should the role of firms be in society? This course will meet once a week to discuss these questions and others about business enterprise. Each week we will focus on interesting and engaging case studies that illustrate key components of strategic management in firms in the U.S. and abroad. The course is designed to be highly interactive, and the principles taught during this course can help students prepare for careers in which they will need to employ strategic thinking. Due to the interactive nature of the course, attendance and in-class participation are graded components.  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, Class Participation, Written Assignments, Final Paper.
