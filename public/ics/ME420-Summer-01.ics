LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:Applied electrochemistry with a focus on energy conversion and storage. Basic concepts of thermodynamics, electrochemistry, and first principal calculations are presented, of which today's fundamentals of electrochemical energy conversion/storage are built. Conventional as well as advanced Li battery concepts/systems and their applications will be a main subject area. intercalation and conversion cathode and anode material families will be introduced and electrochemical function/challenges for energy storage of these materials will be highlighted. Conventional electrolyte materials such as carbonate based liquid electrolyte system and advanced solid-state material will be a topic in class.
