DESCRIPTION:This course will draw on a range of sociological theories and approaches to explore the relationship between education and society.  In particular, the course will focus on themes related to the role of education in social stratification, linkages between education and the economy, polity, and culture, and the organizational contexts of schooling.  More specifically, topics within these themes include: dominant sociological theories (functional, conflict, and institutional) of the functions and roles of education in society, education and its relationship to different forms of capital (human, social and cultural), educational inequalities in achievement and attainment by race, class, and gender, the role of tracking and high stakes examinations in different education systemsaround the world, and the role of globalization in shaping educational goals and policy. The content of the course will focus not only on schooling in the United States, but will draw on cross-national and historical comparisons in order to illuminate the distinctive features of different education systems and provide a broad overview of the relationship between education and society.
