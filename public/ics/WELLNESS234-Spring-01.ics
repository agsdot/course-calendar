LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:Examines forgiveness from a variety of perspectives with an emphasis on its value for physical and mental wellbeing. Presents forgiveness both as a useful response to interpersonal hurt and a teachable skill, backed by scientific research from preventative medicine and psychology. Explores the idea that forgiveness and grievance are both narrative responses to painful experience, but differing in their adaptability and utility.  Spiritual and contemplative approaches are considered, but the methods are secular and research-tested.
