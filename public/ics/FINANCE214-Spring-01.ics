DESCRIPTION:The focus of this course is to apply the fundamental ideas and tools of corporate finance to real-world investment and financing decisions. This course is designed to be the second course in a standard finance sequence; that is, it is designed to be the natural follow-up to the Winter Managerial Finance course. We will develop and extend standard tools and techniques of valuation, and model-building, as well as frameworks and apply these to a wide range of cases. Case topics will include valuation, capital structure choice, financial distress and bankruptcy, agency conflicts and governance, payout policy (and cash management), leveraged buyouts, private equity, mergers and acquisitions, staying private versus going public decision, and valuing control in firms through dual shares and pyramids/keiretsu structure in global settings. Students will be expected to develop detailed model-based analyses for the cases using the tools and techniques we develop in this course, and to employ their analyses to reach and defend specific recommendations for these cases.
