DESCRIPTION:Professor Robin Kelley will teach this course. Of course, this is a history/genealogy of how we got to this place - precarity, mass incarceration, privatization and (re)dispossession of black lives, and the movements that erupted &iquest; all since the early 1970s.  It is as much an intellectual history as it is a political and cultural one since I will circle back to the roots of &quot;neoliberal thinking&iquest; in 18th and 19th century liberalism, colonialism, imperialism, social Darwinism in the so-called &iquest;Gilded Age.&iquest; Will also touch on the rise of social democracy and its recasting of &iquest;liberal&iquest; as the welfare state, the ascendance of military Keynesianism, and Hayek&iquest;s and Milton Freidman&iquest;s Cold War resuscitation and revision of 19th century liberalism.  Much of our reading and discussion will examine the global economic crisis of the 1970s, and the subsequent restructuring of the political economy,  the state, and culture (not limited to the U.S. but looking at the &iquest;Third World&iquest; or Global South&iquest;issues of debt, austerity and structural adjustment policies, environmental destruction, and military intervention.  But the main focus is on how neoliberalism assaulted most black lives while enriching a handful of others; how is spawned a level of state violence that sometimes feels unprecedented and against which many movements emerged.
