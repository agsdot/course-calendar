LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:For graduate, undergraduate and medical students. Focus is on fundamentals of stem cell biology and regenerative Medicine. Topics include exploration of the well-studied system of hematopoiesis, molecular pathways of pluripotency and tissue-specific stem cells and ends with coverage of aging as related to stem cell dynamics. Features include lectures on the basic science of each topic, followed by clinical applications in order to show the mechanisms and methods to translate findings to therapeutic applications, culminated with construction of a research proposal or business plan in an area of interest, to be further explored in STEMREM 203. Students enrolling for 3 units submit four of seven problem-sets; students enrolling for 4 units submit five of seven problem-sets; students enrolling for 5 units turn in seven of seven problem-sets.
