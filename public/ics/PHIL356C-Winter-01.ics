DESCRIPTION:This is a course at the intersection of philosophical logic and artificial intelligence. The goal of the course is to understand the role that expressive logical frameworks might play in AI, and to gain a deeper understanding of how different logical systems relate, and what features of a logical system could make it useful for representation and/or reasoning. Specific themes may include: 1. Tradeoff between complexity and expressivity 2. Capturing subtle reasoning about agent mental states 3. Defeasibility, causality, and the relation between logic and probability 4. Logical formalizations of legal and normative reasoning 5. Combining statistical learning and inference with rich logical structure 6. Logical systems close to the structure of natural language (&quot;natural logics&quot;). Prerequisites: It is expected that students already have a solid background in logic.&nbsp;Phil 151&nbsp;is ideal, but&nbsp;Phil 150&nbsp;or&nbsp;CS 157&nbsp;would be acceptable, with the understanding that there may be some catching up to do. 2 unit option for PhD students only.
