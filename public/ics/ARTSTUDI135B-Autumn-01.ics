DESCRIPTION:Color is a sensation (red), a property of objects (red chair), a metaphor (red alert), a cultural phenomenon (red light district), a political statement (red flag). Color has been studied for millennia, but the open questions about it still outnumber the answered ones. In this course, a series of hands-on projects will lead you to explore color in all its complexity. You will experiment with your own color perception, study public spaces through color, and create a series of artworks that will challenge yours and spectators understanding and perception of color. You will learn how to use digital photography tools and simple physical aids to create color experiments, create unique color experiences that are impossible in the real world, manipulate color of light and objects to create spaces, and delve into cultural and philosophical topics in the class discussions and reading.
