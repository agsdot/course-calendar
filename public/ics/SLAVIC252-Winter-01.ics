DESCRIPTION:What does it mean to write like Chekhov? This class examines Chekhov as the quintessential modern writer and considers his Russian imperial context. We read his early and late prose and the major plays (Seagull, Uncle Vanya, Three Sisters, Cherry Orchard), as well as sample works by his contemporaries. Students write analytical papers and their own Chekhovian stories, and they perform a short play. Readings in English; optional discussion section for students who read Russian.
