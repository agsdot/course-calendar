DESCRIPTION:Almost no country anywhere in the world can afford their healthcare. Starbucks spends more money on healthcare than their coffee. General Motors spends more money on healthcare than steel for their cars. The macro economic effects of healthcare costs along with significant sociodemographic shifts impact every part of our society. In the United States there have been twin massive policy responses (health technology and health payment reform) which are now being coupled with unprecedented venture and industry activity. nnThe purpose of this course will be to understand real world and industry based opportunities within the healthcare system. The course will offer an introductory framework for understanding healthcare configuration encompassing macro economics, health policy 101 and market dynamics. The bulk of the course will focus on the major changes in how (big) data and analytics is being applied in industry and why this matters. There will be an introduction to the most relevant frontier technologies being applied to healthcare data including but not limited to mobility, connectivity, machine learning, &quot;omics&quot;. Each technology will be showcased by a seminar with a relevant company outlining their business model application to a care healthcare data technology. nnWhat differentiates this course from other health policy and health data courses:n-- Marketplace overview + trends (Prospective look at new emerging models versus what has previously worked)n-- Industry perspectiven-- Venture perspectiven-- Data in action (industry applications of &quot;big data&quot;)n-- Course will be heavily focused on real world/industry based application.
