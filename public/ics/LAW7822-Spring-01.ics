DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 726)  We can read any number of books about negotiation, but how do the concepts and principles play out in the real world? This dinner colloquium will meet with distinguished negotiators working in a variety of fields to reflect on and draw lessons from their deep and diverse experience. Guests for this year will speak on: studio and talent perspectives in entertainment negotiations; insights into negotiating strategy for impact litigation (same sex marriage and the &iquest;bathroom&iquest; laws); public policy negotiations in natural resource management; and prosecution and defense perspectives on negotiating in the criminal justice system. Pre-Requisite: Negotiation Seminar or substantial equivalent. Schedule: Wednesday, 5:30-8:00pm. There will be four presentation/dinner discussion sessions during the Winter Quarter. Elements used in grading: Class Participation and Attendance.
