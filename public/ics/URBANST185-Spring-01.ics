DESCRIPTION:This course is an introduction to the urban history of Detroit and a mobilization of that history as a lens through which to study intersections of race, capital, and urban space in the American city. Readings will deal with a set of themes and concepts that open onto explorations of both the specificity of Detroit and larger American urban dynamics.nnThe course will provide students with a basic background in urban studies and, more specifically, with concepts, terms, and language with which to understand and explore relations between race, capitalism, property, and development in urban space; the spatialization of inequality and exclusion; the refraction of urban life and experience by race, ethnicity, and class; the &iquest;decline&iquest; and &iquest;renewal&iquest; of U.S. cities; and modes of contesting and expanding the right to the city. Most broadly, the course will offer students tools to critically interpret narratives of the American city, U.S. urban policy, and projects attempting to engage, respond to, or solve urban problems.
