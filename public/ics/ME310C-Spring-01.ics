DESCRIPTION:Winter and Spring quarters are taken as a unit, with a single grade for both quarters. Admission to ME310BC is by instructor consent, based on an application submitted in December. Industry-project specific teams work with paired design teams at overseas partner universities. Student/project alignment may change from ME310a, depending on enrollment details. International travel, typically during the spring break, is supported but not required. Teams manage a significant budget for prototyping, subcontracting and evaluating product performance. ME310BC embraces a human-centric design philosophy that includes detailed user-experience-testing for one or more identified user populations.
