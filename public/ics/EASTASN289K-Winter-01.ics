DESCRIPTION:As the Republic of Korea (i.e. Korea) faces new challenges of economic stagnation, the role of higher education has become a major focus of policy attention in recent decades.  In particular, in the context of a shrinking working-age population and declining birth rates, the globalization of higher education in Korea has been viewed as a viable solution to attracting skilled labor, questioning long-held cultural beliefs and practices and moving beyond the dominant idea of South Korea as an ethnically &quot;homogenous&quot; country.  How has Korea globalized its higher education sector in recent decades?  How has the internal sociology of Korean universities changed as a result and what contradictions and challenges remain?  How can higher education reform affect Korea's future development?  This course examines the role of globalization of higher education in Korea and its broader implications for social and cultural change in Korea and Asia. May be repeat for credit
