DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 742)  This course is an overview of legal and policy issues connected to federalism.  We will examine a set of core theoretical questions - the values federalism serves; the relationship of federalism and individual and minority rights; and the role of judges in enforcing federalism through judicial review - across a wide range of contemporary legal debates (e.g., same-sex marriage, health care, immigration, voting rights).  While much of the seminar will focus on the United States, we will also consider federalism in comparative context by examining the constitutions and legal doctrines of other regimes.  Special Instructions: After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.  Elements used in grading:  Class Participation, Written Assignments or Research Paper.
