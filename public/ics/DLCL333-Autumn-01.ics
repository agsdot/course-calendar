DESCRIPTION:This course serves as the Core Seminar for the PhD Minor in Philosophy, Literature, and the Arts.  It introduces students to a wide range of topics at the intersection of philosophy with literary and arts criticism.  In this year&iquest;s installment of the seminar, we will focus on issues about the nature of fiction, about the experience of appreciation and what it does for us, about the ethical consequences of imaginative fictions, and about different conceptions of the importance of the arts in life more broadly.  The seminar is intended for graduate students.  It is suitable for theoretically ambitious students of literature and the arts, philosophers with interests in value theory, aesthetics, and topics in language and mind, and other students with strong interest in the psychological importance of engagement with the arts.
