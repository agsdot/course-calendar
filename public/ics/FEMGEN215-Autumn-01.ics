DESCRIPTION:Although the Apostle Paul taught that &quot;There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus&quot; (Gal. 3:28), men and women experienced medieval Christianity in ways that were often vastly different.  In this course we examine the religious experiences of women from the origins of Christianity through to the end of the medieval period, with particular attention paid to female prophets and religious authority, saints and martyrs, sexuality and virginity, literacy and education within the cloister, mysticism, relations between religious women and men, and the relevance of gender in the religious life -- especially as gender intersected with fears of heresy, sin, and embodiment.
