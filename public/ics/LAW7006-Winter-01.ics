DESCRIPTION:This seminar will address a series of interrelated issues that have arisen from America's response to 9/11, including: torture, detention, surveillance, profiling, and dissent. Each of these issues raises a discrete set of legal and policy questions. However, each also offers the chance to explore how the system of checks and balances can and should work during periods of national crisis, the relevance of traditional constitutional constraints on executive power in a national security context, and the enforceability of international legal norms in domestic courts.  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, Class Participation, Final Paper.
