DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 238)  Federal, state and local administrative agencies affect vast areas of life and law practice, including regulation of the environment, immigration, and professional licensing, as well as government benefits.  But who is in charge of government agencies, and what can those agencies do? These are the major questions that permeate administrative law, which is concerned with fair and open government procedures and the checks and balances that control government agencies. Accordingly, this course is concerned with the constitutional rules and political pressures that shape agencies; how agencies promulgate regulations and adjudicate disputes; the major statutes affecting how agencies work, particularly the Administrative Procedure Act; and how courts review agency action.  Elements used in grading:  Final Exam (essay, three hours, open book).
