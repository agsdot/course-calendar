DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 338) This course focuses on the pragmatic (more than theoretical) aspects of contemporary land use law and policy, including: the tools and legal foundation of modern land use law; the process of land development; vested property rights, development agreements, and takings; growth control, sprawl, and housing density; and direct democracy over land use. We explore how land use decisions affect environmental quality and how land use decision-making addresses environmental impacts. Special Instructions: All graduate students from other departments are encouraged to enroll, and no pre-requisites apply. Student participation is essential. Roughly two-thirds of the class time will involve a combination of lecture and classroom discussion. The remaining time will engage students in case studies based on actual land use issues and disputes. Elements used in grading: Attendance, class participation, writing assignments, and final exam. Elements used in grading: Attendance, Class Participation, Final Exam.  This course is cross-listed with Earth Systems (EARTHSYS 238).
