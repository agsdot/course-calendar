DESCRIPTION:How did the deeply entrenched institution of American slavery come to an end? The stories behind this ninety-year transformation are more complex than most people know. This course will examine the particular conditions between 1861 and 1865 that enabled final abolition, and the competing forces between 1776 and 1860 that fostered slavery's preservation and expansion. Throughout, we will encounter a wide range of historical figures, including southerners who tried to undermine slavery, and northerners who helped to defend it.
