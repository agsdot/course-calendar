DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 293)  If there were no legal institution called marriage, would we want to create one? In the context of people's intimate relationships, when and how does the law facilitate and reinforce people's preferences/choices, and when does and should it restrict them? What are (and should be) the sources of legally enforceable obligations between intimates or family members? How does and should the law take account of children, who cannot fend for themselves? This course will consider these questions and more.  Elements used in grading: Exam, with minor adjustments for class participation.
