DESCRIPTION:Traditionally, collective identity the identity of countries, peoples, and other human groups has been studied from the viewpoint of the question who or what are they, the question about the specific traits or contents that define identity. This seminar will undertake a radical epistemological turn, understanding identity as a negotiation of external recognition and internal cohesion. The focus switches from contents to container, from essence to form, from the guts to the skin. The seminar will study examples from Latin America and Europe, with their diverse strategies of identity affirmation or invention. It will also take into consideration the current conflict between Catalonia and Spain as an original case of identity consolidation in a developed society. The instructor will provide the readings. Most of them will be available in English and Spanish. Taught in Spanish. INSTRUCTOR: Salvador Card&uacute;s
