DESCRIPTION:This course is part of the core curriculum of the IDA emphasis in CSRE. This year it will focus on the art and art practice of  women of color in the areas of  literature, visual art and the performing arts.  Through readings, screenings, on and off campus events, and visiting artists, the course will examine the  aesthetics, cultural inquiries, and related politics of Indigenous-identified women artists (especially but not limited to Xicana, Northern Native and African American).  Issues of gender and sexuality in relation to cultural identity are also integral to this exploration. Students will be required to produce a mid-term and final work, integrating the critical concepts of the course into creative projects.
