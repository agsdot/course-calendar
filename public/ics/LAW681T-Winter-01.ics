LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:There have been a number of efforts to define what &quot;law and the humanities&quot; comprehends, some including history and philosophy as disciplines juxtaposed with law and others insisting on a narrower understanding of the field. A newer movement led by Chris Tomlins has rejected the &quot;law and&quot; model entirely and insists instead on formulating interdisciplinary work in law as &quot;law as.&quot; This discussion seminar will examine inductively what law and the humanities might mean and the significance of its contribution by considering a number of essays and articles that could be thought of as work in law and the humanities. Each session will be devoted to a pair of writings around topics like &quot;Law and Literature,&quot; &quot;Legal History,&quot; and &quot;Law and Performance.&quot; Questions to be considered include the role of law within these projects, the audience being addressed, the larger social significance of the arguments being made, and the extent to which the pieces are grounded in a particular discipline or set of disciplines or float above disciplinary formations. The course will take place during Winter Quarter.  Class meeting dates:  The class will meet five Mondays from 4:15 to 6:15p.m. on January 23, 30, February 6, 20, &amp; 27. Elements use in grading: Class attendance at all sessions and class participation.
