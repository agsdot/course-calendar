DESCRIPTION:The globalization of commerce has brought with it the globalization of disputes. Modern disputes may be litigated in courts anywhere in the world. They may be arbitrated under a governing contract or agreement, or against a sovereign state or state-owned entity under a bilateral investment treaty (BIT), free trade agreement (FTA) or foreign investment law. Today most disputes arise in some combination of the above, and may be governed by the domestic law of the forum, foreign law, treaties, or public international law. This course will consider the doctrinal, procedural and practical issues that arise when litigation goes global with a focus on helping students develop the research, writing and analytical skills necessary for a successful transnational practice.  Elements used in grading: class participation, attendance, assignments.
