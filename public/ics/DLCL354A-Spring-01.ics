DESCRIPTION:Join us this quarter for our exploration of the theme &quot;Eat or Be Eaten,&quot; which will look at the representation of the production, preparation, and consumption of food in international film. Through this quarter's films we hope to explore the specific relationships that food creates; relationships between family members, chefs, food workers, and consumers, humans and animals, and animals and plants.  We will look at the history of what is served on a plate and the consequences of what is eaten, both in moments of excess and of starvation. To approach this theme we will look at a variety of film genres including documentary, art house, Hollywood, and horror in order to compare the representation of eating across schools of cinema, different film technologies, and film history. Discussion will analyze how relationships around food highlight issues of sustainability, gender, race, and class. Please be aware that some films may include graphic or disturbing content. Viewers are advised to familiarize themselves with the films' content before viewing. All screenings are free and open to the public and audience members are encouraged to participate in the discussions following the films. Please also note that grades for this course are entirely dependent on attendance, which is taken at the end of each screening.  Enrolled students MUST attend AT LEAST SEVEN screenings in order to obtain credit. May be repeat for credit
