DESCRIPTION:Join us this Autumn quarter for our exploration of the theme &quot;Nature,&quot; which will look at the representation of the natural world, animals, and landscape in international film. From Arnold Fanck's &quot;The Holy Mountain,&quot; to Ver&oacute;nica Llin&aacute;s' &quot;Dog Lady,&quot; and Disney's recent &quot;Zootopia,&quot; we will discuss the roles and representation of wildness and wilderness in cinema.  Documentaries &quot;Rivers and Tides&quot; and &quot;Chasing Ice&quot; will allow us to discuss which media best enable us to perceive natural systems and illustrate our dependence on them, especially in the era of climate change. Comparing the grotesque insects of &quot;Microcosmos&quot; to the exquisite aerial views of &quot;Samsara&quot; will open a conversation about the role of technology in representing and understanding nature in film.  Finally, we will finish the series with Terrence Malick's &quot;Thin Red Line&quot; and Apichatpong Weerasethakul's &quot;Uncle Boonmee,&quot; which offer unique interpretations of how humans live within and without nature's rules.  Discussions will focus on analyzing the relationships between man and nature, nature and technology, and landscape and film, with special attention to issues around technology, gender, race, and class, as well as the different ways that film has represented nature across cultures, schools of cinema, film technologies, and time.nnAll screenings are free and open to the public and audience members are encouraged to participate in the discussions following the films. Please note that grades for this course are entirely dependent on attendance of at least seven screenings.  Please be aware that some films may include graphic or disturbing content: Viewers are therefore advised to familiarize themselves with the films' content before viewing.  May be repeated for credit.
