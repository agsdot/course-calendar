DESCRIPTION:Nearly 80,000 individuals who identify as Latino or Latina, turn 18 every MONTH in the United States alone.. Yet despite the rapid growth in numbers and a presence on this continent that predates the country itself, Latina/os are still spoken of largely through the lens of immigration, and primarily during the window of election seasons. This course will design, engage, and deliver human centered strategies and relational activations for transforming national narratives while advancing well being. Our core questions include:n - Who defines a people, and who is involved in definition making? n  - What are the ways to engage story beyond marketing concepts into a platform for human connection? n  - How does one &iquest;hack&iquest; a national narrative?n  - How do relational activations like pop up dinners and listening parties create personal doorways for transformation that can be scaled without sacrificing quality?nnPlease note, GENTE is more than an identity-based course. It is initiative that designs blueprints for change-making across identities by curating stories, values and common histories of individuals into a shared future of well being.
