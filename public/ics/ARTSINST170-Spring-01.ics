DESCRIPTION:What does it mean to be a walking body in a world? What kind of world? What kind of body? This course looks at walking as a performative act and considers 20th and 21st century responses to these questions in philosophy, theater, literature, video games, and protest movements. We will connect the threads between Baudelaire and #Gamergate, Italo Calvino and Journey, the revolution of 1968 and the Occupy movement. We will read digressive texts, grapple with philosophers from Walter Benjamin to Michel de Certeau, play &iquest;Walking Simulator&iquest; video games, and walk through pedestrian performances. In addition to reading and writing responses to the texts, we will create our own performances and conceptualize our own Walking Sims.
