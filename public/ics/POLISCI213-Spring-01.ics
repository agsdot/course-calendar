LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:A quarter century ago, the Soviet Union collapsed and the Cold War ended. At the time, Russian leaders aspired to build democratic and market institutions at home. They also wanted to join the West. American presidents Democrat and Republican encouraged these domestic and international changes. Today, U.S.-Russia relations are once again confrontational, reminiscent of relations during the Cold War. This course seeks to analyze shifts in U.S.-Russia relations, with special attention given to the U.S.-Russia relationship during Obama&iquest;s presidency. Readings will include academic articles and a book manuscript by Professor McFaul on Obama's reset policy.  Open to students with previous coursework involving Russia.  This course will meet bi-weekly Wednesdays from 1:30-3:20pm on the following dates (4/12, 4/26, 5/10, 5/24, and 6/7).
