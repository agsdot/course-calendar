DESCRIPTION:In this course we will deepen our focus on many African and African diaspora movement traditions and their influences on Western contemporary dance with an emphasis on dance traditions of Cuba, Brazil, and Haiti. Our study of these dance disciplines will inform the movement vocabulary, technical training, class discussions, and choreography we experience in this course. Students will learn more about the dances and rhythms for the Orishas of Brazil and Cuba, and the Loa of Haiti with an additional focus on other African diaspora dance forms such as, house dance, salsa, Cuban Haitian, Palo, Samba and Samba-Reggae. Through our warm ups and class choreography, we will deepen our analysis of how African diaspora movement traditions are inherently embedded in many expressions of the broadly termed form known as contemporary dance.
