DESCRIPTION:This course is designed for preclinical medical students interested in acquiring the technical skills and a clinical orientation necessary to learn and participate in the surgical environment. Additionally,  the course will introduce students to the profession of surgery, with opportunities for surgical faculty mentorship. Scrub training starts the course to facilitate the learning of sterile technique required prior to participation in the operating room. Students will learn techniques in preparing for an operative case with a resident and attending surgeon. Technical training will include basic knot tying and suturing workshops. Students will employ these techniques in operative cases through simulation. The class will require a mandatory operative shadowing experience with an attending surgeon outside of normal class hours. Preference is given to second year students.
