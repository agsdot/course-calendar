DESCRIPTION:How might we imagine string quartet as a theatrical genre? This thought experiment informs a collaboration between Mohr Visiting Artist Majel Connery, Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Caroline Shaw, and the Saint Lawrence String Quartet. This seminar serves as a laboratory for that collaboration, offering a forum to explore side by side with Connery, SLSQ and Shaw the conceptual origins of the project and soliciting students' creative involvement. Orbiting around signal works for string quartet and voice, the course combines the critical rigor of graduate-level work with the practical grit of a studio workshop, and culminates in a suite of student performances. This course must be taken for a minimum of 3 units and a letter grade to be eligible for Ways credit. Enrollment limited to 15.
