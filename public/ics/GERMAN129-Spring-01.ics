DESCRIPTION:What does a narrator who declares himself &quot;insane&quot; make us reevaluate as readers or viewers? How do literary texts portray sanatoriums and the people who inhabit them? From the unreliable narrator to the sudden twist ending, madness is often made into a literary trope; the insane asylum, too, becomes a symbol of broader socio-political concerns. This course looks at the representations of clinics and sanatoriums in classic German texts of the 20th century, engaging critically with these representations and the ways in which insanity and illness are depicted. We will compare texts from several genres (novel, film, drama, or video game), to see how the rules change depending on the form used. Texts will include Robert Wiene's masterful expressionist film &quot;Das Cabinet des Doktor Caligari&quot;; excerpts from Thomas Mann&iquest;s &quot;Der Zauberberg&quot;; excerpts from Gunter Grass' postwar masterpiece &quot;Die Blechtrommel&quot;; Friedrich D&uuml;rrenmatt's &quot;Die Physiker&quot;, a coldwar theatrical screed on the dangers of science in a nuclear age; and the mysterious point-and-click adventure game &quot;Edna bricht aus.&quot; Taught in German. Prerequisite: GERLANG 3 or permission of instructor.
