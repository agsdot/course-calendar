LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 572)  This seminar explores strategic and legal issues related to using law reform and social justice litigation to advance the constitutional and civil rights of vulnerable communities, particularly with regard to litigation against the federal government. The focus this quarter will be examining the role of litigation in response to some current federal initiatives, particularly but not exclusively with regard to the rights of non-citizens.  No previous experience or study of immigration law is expected; the seminar is open to all 2L and 3L students interested in the topic.  The course will be informed by the instructor's thirty years of litigating class action and appellate cases, including in the Supreme Court, as the founder and former national director of the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project and recent service in the Obama administration as senior counselor to the Secretary of Homeland Security.  The seminar is designed to analyze doctrinal and strategic litigation responses to issues of broad public policy and social justice.  Among the topics that may be included are selecting and using test cases; identifying plaintiffs; coalition litigation; strategic pleading; class action problems; the role of amicus briefs; suits for damages versus injunctive relief; standing and mootness; ethical problems; settlement strategies; use of public advocacy and media; the effect of lawsuits on policymakers and public officials; the role of government and agency lawyers; and litigation to achieve legislative change. Guest speakers will be invited.  Enrollment is limited and the seminar is not open to 1L students. Students will either (a) submit a series of reflections or analytical pieces (totaling 18 pages) responding to seminar issues and guest speakers or (b) request approval for Research (R) credit to write a substantial research paper on an approved topic of current significance. R credit is available only with the instructor's prior consent early in the quarter.  Students approved for R credit will transfer from section (01) into section (02) after the term begins. Elements used in grading: Class participation (50%) and written submissions (50%). CONSENT APPLICATION: To apply for this course, students must complete and submit a Consent Application Form available on the SLS website (Click Courses at the bottom of the homepage and then click Consent of Instructor Forms). See Consent Application Form for instructions and submission deadline.  A background in immigration law is not required for this seminar.
