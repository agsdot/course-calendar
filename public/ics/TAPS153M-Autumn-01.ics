DESCRIPTION:This course explores the history of technologies vital to the theatre: traps, lifts, lights, and sounds have been crucial for creating stage illusion.  Divided into three main sections, Mechanics and Machines, Lighting and Projections, and Acoustics and Sound, we will examine the history of technological innovation and theatrical experimentation from the Enlightenment to the present. We will also be conducting case studies for each section with a core text or texts.  We will cover Shakespeare's Hamlet,  Ibsen's Ghosts, Chekhov's The Seagull, and Dreamgirls, The Musical. n nTechnologies such as mechanical traps, electrical lights, and sound machines have been used to create stunning illusions and spectacular theater.  Many of these technologies were also significant for the histories of industrialization and modernization.  We will ask: How did theater makers develop and innovate using technological innovations? What role does technological aesthetics play in understanding human culture?  What are the relationships between theater, technology, and society?  In class, we will be reading, experimenting, and performing with various technological artifacts.  We will be conducting experiments alongside our reading practice to better understand our historical subjects.
