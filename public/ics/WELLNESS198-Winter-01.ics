DESCRIPTION:This course helps students better manage their stress and sleep more soundly.  It does so by presenting the latest findings in the science of stress and sleep. Functional definitions of stress and perceived stress are given, student stress levels are assessed, and tools are given to manage stress more effectively.  Students learn about the sleep cycle and its effect on the brain, understand the causes of insomnia, track their sleep behaviors, and practice getting a better night&iquest;s sleep by using cognitive-behavioral interventions rooted in the latest findings of sleep research. By the end of the course students will be more empowered to work effectively with stress and sleep so they have more clarity, focus, and energy in their day-to-day lives.
