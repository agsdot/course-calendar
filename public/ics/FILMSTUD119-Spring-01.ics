DESCRIPTION:The course will focus on science fiction films that take as a central theme human and nonhuman intelligence and its mediation. Possible films include Solaris, 2001:  A Space Odyssey, THX 1138, Tron, Videodrome, Invasion of the Body Snatchers (multiple versions), and Wall-E.  How does cinema, through sound and set design, mise-en-sc&egrave;ne, cinematography, and animation, engage science fiction&iquest;s exploration of technological and social change, the boundaries of human and non-human, and the nature of cognition, imagination and identity? Are these concerns at the heart of filmmaking or is science fiction a genre at odds with cinema, the most technological of the arts?
