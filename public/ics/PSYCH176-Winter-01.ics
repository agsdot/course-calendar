DESCRIPTION:Early childhood is a time of both enormous promise and considerable risk.  Parents differ widely in their practices and beliefs about their role in enabling children to avoid risk and achieve their potential.  In this seminar we will evaluate evidence from the biological and social sciences showing how positive and negative experiences in infancy have profound and enduring effects on early brain architecture, with consequences for later development in childhood and adulthood.  We will also consider the challenges of designing more effective social policies to provide support for families in diverse socioeconomic and cultural contexts, with the goal of helping more children to reach their full potential.  A community-service learning option is also included.  Pre-requisites: Psych 01 and Psych 60, or Human Biology 3B.
