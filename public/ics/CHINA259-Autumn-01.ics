DESCRIPTION:This course discusses a story of twin cities &iquest; Beijing and Shanghai, from the imperial period to the present day. The historical movement of people, goods, knowledge, thoughts, technology and shifting of political power and cultural authority has closely linked the two cities together. No other two cities in the Chinese map have more communications, interactions, and mutual influences than Beijing and Shanghai. Indeed, geographic localities, ethnic traits, material lives, and foreign contacts have produced distinct cultural landscapes and patterns of urban development of the twin cities, which provide us with a good case of comparative studies. In Beijing and Shanghai, contemporary forces, including migration, industrialization, marketization, decentralization and globalization are transforming the urban societies. Both of them take center stage in China&iquest;s drama of explosive growth and unprecedented changes. They continue to compete and influence each other in many ways.
