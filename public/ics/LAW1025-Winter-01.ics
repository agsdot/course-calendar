DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 721)  This course has been created to supplement Law 1024, Private Equity Investing.  The focus will be on the quantitative aspects of private equity investing. Students will learn the skills required to do the financial analysis and spreadsheet modeling utilized in this milieu.  Mastery of these fundamentals will allow students to develop and strengthen their ability to prepare forecasts, craft deal structures and run the numbers on real world transactions.  Special Instructions:  In order to enroll in PEI:  Quantitative Skills students must concurrently enroll in Private Equity Investing (LAW 1024).  In other words, no student may enroll in either Law 1024 or Law 1025 without also enrolling in the other.  Students accepted to enroll in Private Equity Investing (for which a Consent Application Form is required) will automatically be able to enroll in LAW 1025.  Law 1025 will be graded on a Mandatory Pass/Restricted Credit/Fail (MP/R/F) basis.  Elements used in grading:  Class attendance, participation and written assignments.
