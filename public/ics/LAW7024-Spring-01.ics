LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:This seminar explores legal and policy issues related to our food system, including the regulation of food supply, food safety, nutrition / obesity, marketing / labeling, security, and animal treatment.  We will examine how laws and regulations affect the production, distribution, sale, and consumption of food and whether particular regulatory approaches (e.g., product bans, product standards, government subsidies, taxes, information disclosure, or labeling) are more effective in achieving public goals.  Instructions: Grades will be based on class attendance, class participation, and either several short reflection papers (section (01)) or an independent research paper (section (02)). After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor. Students taking the course for R credit can take the course for either 2 or 3 units, depending on paper length.
