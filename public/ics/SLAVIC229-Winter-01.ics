DESCRIPTION:Nikolai Gogol's national identity has been often discussed in terms of his vacillation between Ukrainian and Russian nationalisms. However, his literary legacy has not yet to be studied as the clash and competition of the two national literary traditions. In the course, we will identify the generic forms and poetics of the medieval Rus' and Ukrainian baroque, as well as Russian classicist and sentimentalist traditions that shaped Gogol's literary style. In addition to studying his poetics, we will apply post-structuralist and postcolonial literary theory to analyze Gogol's idiosyncratic language and persona.
