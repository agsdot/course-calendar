The course is the foundation for advanced business courses. We focus on problems that arise because a firm's managers and owners have conflicting interests. We examine the costs associated with this conflict and how markets, legal rules and contracts might reduce them. Special Instructions: QM: Finance (Law 467) is recommended. Elements used in grading: Class participation, attendance, written assignments, midterm, final exam.
