DESCRIPTION:A course on the resurgence of interest in the manner in which the things we say can morally affect other people, in ways both good and bad. Examples include slurs and honorifics, the formation of language in sexist ways, and communicative inequalities. We will explore the recent literature at the intersection of philosophy of language, moral philosophy, and feminist philosophy. We will ask: to what extent are these fundamentally moral problems that just happen to use language? To what extent are these moral issues inextricably tied to (our) language itself? Based on our answers to these questions, what should we as a society do? Will changing our language or our linguistic practices solve these problems. If not, what will?
