DESCRIPTION:This seminar will consider the subject of self-taught artists, who form a shadow history of American art.  We will examine their work and reception by fine artists and institutions in the United States, looking specifically at how they aligned with, departed from, or helped define received art historical narratives.  Special attention will be paid to issues of collecting and display, the shifting terms used to designate &quot;self-taught,&quot; and theoretical and ethical concerns raised by the study of self-taught artists. Key themes will include theories of the archive, race, spirituality and enchantment, and disability.  How might study of self-taught artists transform our understanding of canonical art historical movements? How does self-taught art challenge what it means to write about, research, and encounter objects in the world?
