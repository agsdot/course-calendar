DESCRIPTION:Social cognition &iquest; the ability to recognize others, understand their behaviors, and reason about their thoughts &iquest; is a critical component of what makes us human. What are the basic elements of social cognition, and what do children understand about other people&iquest;s actions, thoughts, and feelings? How do these capacities help us understand the world, as learning unfolds in the first few years of life?  This course will take a deeper look at the intersection of social cognition and cognitive development to better understand how children learn about the world.nnStudents will explore various topics on social cognition with an emphasis on (but not limited to) developmental perspectives, including face perception, action understanding, Theory of Mind, communication, and altruism, and think about how these abilities might be linked to the developmental changes in children&iquest;s understanding of the world. The course will encourage students to think hard about the fundamental questions about the human mind and how it interacts with other minds, and the value of studying young children in addressing these questions. Students should expect to read, present, and discuss theoretical and empirical research articles and to develop original research proposals as a final project.  nnStudents will have an opportunity to develop their proposals into a research project in PSYCH 187, a lab course offered every other year in Spring (next offer expected to be Spring 2018) as a sequel to this course.  This course fulfills the WIM requirement. nnPrerequisitesPsych60 or Psych141, or see instructor
