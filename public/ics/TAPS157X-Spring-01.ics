DESCRIPTION:How have artists and activists have used performance to raise vital questions about citizenship, identity, community, and human agency in migrant contexts? In this class, we will examine a range of theatre and performance pieces from across the globe that address urgent issues of migration and border-crossing, including experiences of refugees, asylum seekers, and environmental migrants. We will study the various aesthetic strategies that performance-makers have used to tell these stories, their outreach to audiences, and the political potential of their work. The course blends readings of critical and creative texts with practical workshops to give participants the opportunity to develop their own performances as well as written work.
