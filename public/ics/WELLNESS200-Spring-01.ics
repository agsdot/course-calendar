DESCRIPTION:Explores the history, current trends, and future speculations on the role that modern technologies play in psychological, emotional and spiritual wellbeing on an individual and collective scale. From stone tools to mars rovers, technology is a defining human quality. With the same consistency, the search for wellbeing is a fundamental human impulse. In what ways do science and technology support our search for peace and happiness? Because this is a new and evolving idea space, there are no widely established theories or principles to hand down. Instead there are disparate fields from which this course is drawn, including: Contemplative Science, Neurophenomenology, Positive Psychology, Biomedical Engineering, and Brain Stimulation &amp; Neurofeedback (usually psychiatry). Students will play an active role in discussing and developing the core questions, concerns, ethical considerations, and broad implications of technologies that can rapidly shift human consciousness on a massive global scale. Course includes direct interaction with significant technologies and major luminaries in the space.
