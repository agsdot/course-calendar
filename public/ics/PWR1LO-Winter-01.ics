DESCRIPTION:With increasing rates of environmental impacts from human activity, communities across the planet face challenges for sustainability. Given the many benefits we derive from nature - from cultural and spiritual benefits, to basic goods like food and water, to economic benefits from the use of natural resources - defining what we value and what we wish to sustain is a top priority. This class will examine diverse perspectives on the value and services we derive from nature and consider challenges for balancing multiple uses of nature in the context of sustainable resource management and conservation.

Enrollment is handled by the PWR office.
