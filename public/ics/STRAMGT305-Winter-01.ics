DESCRIPTION:This course is an advanced applications economics course. The course has two main components, game theory and competitive strategy. Game theory is the field of study of interactive strategic decision making. In recent years it has become a prominent approach in both research and in practice. We will apply game theoretical models to a variety of industry, market and other relational settings. Beyond the use of game theory in competitive strategy in general, we will spend a significant part of the course studying competitive advantages in depth. In particular, we will cover the various types of competitive advantages and barriers to entry, attributes of an advantage, the creation and dynamics of advantages and more.
