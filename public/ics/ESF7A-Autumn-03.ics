DESCRIPTION:Socrates famously claimed that the unexamined life is not worth living.&nbsp; Socrates and other ancient thinkers examined themselves and found that they did not match up to their own ideals.&nbsp; They thus set out to transform themselves to achieve a good and happy life.&nbsp; What is the good life?&nbsp; How do we change ourselves to live a good and happy life?&nbsp; How do literature and philosophy help us to understand ourselves and to achieve our social, ethical, and personal ideals? In this class, we examine Socrates and Augustine&iquest;s lives and ideas.&nbsp; Each struggled to live a good and happy life.&nbsp; In each case, they urge us to transform ourselves into better human beings.&nbsp; The first half of the course focuses on the Athenian Socrates, who was put to death because he rejected traditional Greek ideals and and proclaimed a new kind of ethical goodness.&nbsp; The second half focuses on the North African Augustine, an unhappy soul who became a new man by converting to Christianity.&nbsp; These thinkers addressed questions and problems that we still confront today:&nbsp; What do we consider to be a happy life?&nbsp; Do we need to be good and ethical people to live happily?&nbsp; Is there one correct set of values?&nbsp; How do we accommodate other people&iquest;s beliefs?&nbsp; Is it possible to experience a transformation of the self?&nbsp; How exactly do we change ourselves to achieve our higher ideals?
