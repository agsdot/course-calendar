DESCRIPTION:(Same as SOMGEN 230/FEMGEN 230). Focus is on development of personal and professional skills to interact with people across the diverse range of human sexuality, from childhood (pediatric) to older ages (geriatric), with consideration of gender identity, sexual orientation, sociocultural (predominantly U.S., not global) and religious values, and selected medical issues (e.g. hormonal therapy, disabilities, e.g. spinal cord injury, etc. with discussion of sexual taboos and unusual sexual practices that you might encounter in a general medical setting. For the additional unit, students will undertake an additional weekly activity (e.g., shadowing in a clinic) approved by the instructor and submit a weekly written reflection about that activity.
