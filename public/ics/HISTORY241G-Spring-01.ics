DESCRIPTION:Contemporary arguments concerning the relationship between science and religion often emphasize their differences, either as incompatible modes of thought in conflict, or as equally valid but &quot;non-overlapping magisterial,&quot; which is to say inherently separate domains of inquiry. Such stark distinctions are a relatively recent development. The story of the relationship between science and spiritual belief is one of historically intimate connections and mutual influences. In this class we will examine forms of engagement of scientific and religious ideas in the West from 1500 to the present day.
