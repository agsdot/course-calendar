LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:This course traces the development of legislatures from their medieval European origins to the present, with primary emphasis on the case of the U.S. Congress.  Students will learn about the early role played by assemblies in placing limits on royal power, especially via the power of the purse. About half the course will then turn to a more detailed consideration of the U.S. Congress's contemporary performance, analyzing how that performance is affected by procedural legacies from the past that affect most democratic legislatures worldwide.
