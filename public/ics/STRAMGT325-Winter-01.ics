DESCRIPTION:This course is for students who may want to undertake an entrepreneurial career by starting and/or joining the senior management team of a social venture.  It covers all phases of a venture - ideation and venture creation, resource acquisition, managing growth and harvest/exit.  The instructors believe, for the most part, social ventures (which include both for-profit and non-profit structures) should be treated and managed like profit maximizing ventures, and many topics and themes encountered in this course will be similar to those covered in other entrepreneurial courses, such as Formation of New Ventures.  Of course there are important differences related specifically to social ventures, some of which are critical to understand properly to effectively start and manage a social enterprise.  We will highlight these differences throughout our sessions, so while that the lessons learned in this class can be generalized to all ventures, we do not advise you to take this class unless you really want to learn about social ventures.  All the cases used in class and class discussions will be about early stage companies and organizations in the social venture space. Guests, both social entrepreneurs active in the field, and social impact investors, are heavily featured in class discussions and are an important part of the classroom experience.
