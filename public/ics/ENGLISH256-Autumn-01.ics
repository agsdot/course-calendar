DESCRIPTION:This course will examine influential American poetry of the postwar period, taking as its starting point the poets included in Donald Allen&iquest;s landmark anthology <i>The New American Poetry: 1945-1960</i>. After a reading of the Beat, Black Mountain, and New York School poets found there, we will probe the limits of Allen&iquest;s selection, considering figures proximate to the New Americans or influenced by them. Topics to be discussed will include the relationship between New American poetry and its modernist predecessors, the status of poetic form, and the connection between these literary movements and the social movements of the 1960s and 1970s.
