LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:In nearly all polls, American voters rank the economy as one of their most important concerns.  In the presidential election, full debates are dedicated to questions of economic policy.  In this course, we will delve deeply into economic policy issues to understand options for government intervention and possible outcomes.  Focus will be on the economic issues, not on the political aspects of the campaign.  Specific areas of interest will be taxation, budget, entitlement programs, economic regulation and competition policy, trade, demography, income inequality, and monetary policy.  We expect to incorporate timely and salient economic issues as they arise during the course of the campaign.  The course will include four days of meetings in Washington, DC with economic policy analysts. Students will be expected to write a short paper and make an oral presentation to the class. A wide range of topics will be acceptable, including those directly related to campaign issues as well as other long-term economic issues facing the country. Sophomore College course, applications required by deadline April 5, 2016. Apply at http://soco.stanford.edu.
