DESCRIPTION:This course will examine consumer culture in the United States, first focusing on the rise of advertising, mass market goods, catalogues, and department stores at the turn of the 20th century. We will then examine post-WWII suburbia and the rise of the &quot;good life&quot; and the ensuing backlash in 1960s counterculture anti-consumerist movements. Our topics will include the annual no-shopping day, back to nature movements, urban homesteading, slow food activism, and the efforts to resist mass production in food, clothing, and housing. Sources include novels, films, magazines, punk and folk music, and advertisements.
