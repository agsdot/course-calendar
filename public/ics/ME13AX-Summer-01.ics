LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:In this course students will explore the inherent order in 3-dimensional space that underlies and determines nature of form and structure, and then use that knowledge to inform the design and fabrication of original artworks. A survey of relevant artists and architects will suggest the rich potential for creative expression that results from a deep understanding of the nature of space. Topics will include: symmetry, pattern, tessellation, duality, transformation, polyhedra, space-filling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The course will be conducted in Room 36, a state-of-the art maker space. Students will learn how to use a professional CAD program and a computer-controlled laser cutter to create models out of paper, plastic, and wood. Students will have access to 3D printers, and other digital and analog fabrication tools.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Students considering taking this course need not have any background in the visual arts, but should have a firm foundation and avid interest in geometry. Access to a Mac or Windows Laptops is required.
