DESCRIPTION:Complex analysis is closely related to potential theory, appearing in a variety of engineering disciplines, including flow dynamics, electrostatics, heat conduction and gravity fields. This course is devoted to explaining the fundamentals of complex analysis and instructing on how to develop mathematical tools to solve engineering problems in potential theory. Individual topics are lectured with motivating problems, so that students can understand why these subjects need to be covered and how these are applied to practical engineering problems.
