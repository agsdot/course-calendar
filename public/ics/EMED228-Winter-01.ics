DESCRIPTION:Do you have a story to tell? Would you like to make an impact on emergency care through film? Would you like to work as part of a film team? Film has an increasing role in shaping the public's perceptions of and relationship to healthcare, with huge potential to act as a vehicle for impactful change. This course will describe and practice the entire filmmaking process from preproduction and production through to postproduction completion. Step by step you will learn to tell stories that matter in ways that will get people to care. You will learn visual strategies for imparting exciting knowledge. When the quarter is complete, we will have produced a film from start to finish that you can share. No prior film experience is required.
