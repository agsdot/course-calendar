LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:This course explores how our behavior in the present is guided by our past experiences, and how we can apply these principles to our own learning and to the broader world around us. We will explore the theory of learning and memory, including an introduction to multiple memory systems, the ways in which memory can succeed but also fail, and how memory integrity changes across the lifespan and across clinical populations. We will also explore applications of this theoretical content to the real world technologies and policies that touch our everyday lives, such as applications in brain training, advertising, the legal system, and the classroom.
