DESCRIPTION:From traps, to lifts, to sugar glass props, the stage absorbs and utilizes technological and scientific innovations for its own illusions.  In this course, we will examine the history of stagecraft through the technologies and scientific theories that came to define its spectacle.  We will explore innovations in perspective scenery, stage mechanics, and lighting design as well as significant stage illusions from the seventeenth century to the present.  Readings will include treatises on mechanical apparatus, stage machinery, and architectural theories; schematics, blueprints, and patents of theatre spaces; and readings on theatre theory and stage design.  One Shakespeare play, and later twentieth-century adaptations, will provide the focal narrative around which we will examine how changing theories and technologies influence the possibilities of representation.  The play will be drawn from The Tempest, Midsummer Night&iquest;s Dream, or Hamlet with selected twentieth- century adaptations. Creative projects will be included in the course work.
