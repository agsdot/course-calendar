DESCRIPTION:The Anthropocene refers to the proposed geologic age defined by the global footprint of humankind. It's an acknowledgement of the tremendous influence people and societies exert on Earth systems. In this course, students research, prepare, and conduct audio interviews related to the Anthropocene with experts of their choosing. Instructors will help facilitate interviews and prepare student for the experience. Throughout the quarter students will participate in group workshops. This is a project-based course resulting in two long-form interviews. The expectation at the end of the quarter is to publish interviews via the Generation Anthropocene podcast, with possible opportunities to cross post in collaboration with external media partners. Students hoping to take EarthSys 135/235 during winter quarter are strongly encouraged to enroll in EarthSys 135A/235A. (Cardinal Course certified by the Haas Center).
