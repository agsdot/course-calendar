LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:This seminar will design a course on mitigating global poverty, with the plan of teaching the course in 2017-18. The client will be Robert Daines, Associate Dean for Global Programs at Stanford Law School.  We will consider, among other things: the roles of US, European, and multilateral aid agencies and lending institutions; foreign aid, foreign direct investment, and trade policies; the UN's Sustainable Development Goals; the role of foundations and international NGOs; refugees and internally displaced persons; disaster and emergency relief; particular programs aimed at improving health, education, including conditional and unconditional cash transfers; and the promise and limits of technology.  We will read from the major literature, including some recent books on the causes of and approaches to mitigating global poverty, and have guest speakers on these subjects. Focusing on particular subjects of their interest, students will produce annotated readings, case studies, and summary outlines for particular topics. Although we will be particularly interested in the role of law and public policy, we will not exclude other approaches to poverty alleviation.  After the term begins, students accepted into the course can transfer from section (01) into section (02), which meets the R requirement, with consent of the instructor.  Elements used in grading:  Class Participation, Attendance, Written Assignments.  --  NOTE: Students may not count more than a combined total of eight units of directed research projects and policy lab practica toward graduation unless the additional counted units are approved in advance by the Petitions Committee. Such approval will be granted only for good cause shown. Even in the case of a successful petition for additional units, a student cannot receive a letter grade for more than eight units of independent research (Policy Lab practicum, Directed Research, Directed Writing, Senior Thesis, and/or Research Track). Any units taken in excess of eight will be graded on a mandatory pass basis. For detailed information, see &quot;Directed Research/Policy Labs&quot; in the SLS Student Handbook.  CONSENT APPLICATION: To apply for this course, students must complete and submit a Consent Application Form available on the SLS website (Click Courses at the bottom of the homepage and then click Consent of Instructor Forms). See Consent Application Form for instructions and submission deadline.
