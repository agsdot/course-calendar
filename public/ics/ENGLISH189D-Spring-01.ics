DESCRIPTION:Classic literary and scientific works by writers such as Darwin, Thomas Hardy, Einstein, and Virginia Woolf. Considers how literature assays the consequences and potential of  scientific theories within the subtle orderings of narrative, how a scientific theory is developed through and precipitated in language, and how novelists and scientists think outside the accumulated meanings of their time. Attends to their shared methods and preoccupations, including rendering visible the invisible; the idea of the generally  significant individual; changing models of the shape of history; the contours of experiment; the cult and culture of experience and the dream of objectivity; regulative and investigatory fictions. Some discussion of literature and medicine.
