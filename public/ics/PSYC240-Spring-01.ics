DESCRIPTION:The WHO estimates that by 2030 mental health conditions will be the #1 cause of disease burden globally. The field of mental healthcare is ripe for improvement and innovation, including education and prevention, increasing access, collaborative care, decreasing stigma, technology, and more just policies. This course guides students to think about mental health through the lens of leadership and innovation, and to develop practical ideas for improving outcomes. We will consider realities of clinical care, mental health care&iquest;s controversial history, effective potency, culture, stigma, and how to make change within a complex system with multiple stakeholders. The course welcomes students of diverse backgrounds looking to contribute to the many facets of mental health.
