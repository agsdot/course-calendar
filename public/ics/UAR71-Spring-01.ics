DESCRIPTION:In this course, students will find the space to define their study abroad experience as well as articulate the ways in which their worldview perspectives may have shifted.  Therefore, students will engage in deep mutual exchanges and personal introspection about their experiences abroad.  Throughout the course, we will define their experience abroad while continually making-meaning as their new perspectives are supported and challenge amongst members of the Stanford community.  Students will end the course by crafting action steps for moving forward with the ability to tell their study abroad story in compelling ways that can be applied to personal, social, academic, and professional realms of their lives.
