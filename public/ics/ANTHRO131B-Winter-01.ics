DESCRIPTION:What are social networks and how do they influence patterns we observe in the world around us? Although the rise of social media and big data has made social network analysis (SNA) a hot topic in recent years, scholars in anthropology and sociology have been analyzing social networks and interaction patterns - and related debates over structure and agency - since the early days of these disciplines.nThis course will introduce upper-level undergraduates to the theory and methods used in social network analysis. Coursework will involve problem sets, student presentations, and weekly participation. The main output of the course however will be a student-designed project analyzing social relationships in a community (virtual, historical, or physical-world) of interest. There are no prerequisites, but familiarity with R would be helpful. Lectures on R will be provided early in the course, so if you&iquest;re interested in thinking creatively about social relationships, don't let your lack of programming experience be a deterrent!
