DESCRIPTION:Why hasn't electricity from solar panels, wind turbines, and other environmentally friendly resources taken over our energy landscape? Why is a hybrid car or an all-electric vehicle so expansive? In this seminar we will explore energy technologies and focus on how development in materials science enables a greener future. This seminar takes a hands-on approach; we will make solar cells and batteries and generate our own electricity. We will also include field trips to companies running large-scale energy production and green energy for transportation. Lastly we will explore advanced energy materials research at Stanford and find what still needs to be done in order to achieve a sustainable energy landscape.
