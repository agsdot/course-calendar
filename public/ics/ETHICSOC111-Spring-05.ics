DESCRIPTION:This course will examine the responsibilities and challenges for those who occupy leadership roles in professional, business, non-profit, and academic settings. Topics will include: characteristics and styles of leadership, organizational dynamics, forms of influence, decision-making, diversity, and ethical responsibilities. Class sessions will include visitors who have occupied leadership roles. Students will also have the opportunity to participate in a placement for 1 additional unit through the Haas Center with leaders of local non-profit organizations, foundations, and government offices. Through these experiential placements, students will see the responsibilities and challenges of leadership firsthand, across a variety of sectors and organizational settings. Placements are limited, and interested students should indicate their interest when applying. Requirements will include class participation and short written weekly reflection papers (2-3 pages) on the assigned readings. Students should submit a resume and a description of no more than one page of relevant leadership experiences, interests, and motivations for taking the course.
