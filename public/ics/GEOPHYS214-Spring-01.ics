DESCRIPTION:The course will introduce the new generation of methods used for investigating groundwater systems. The primary focus would be on methods for estimating the components of the aquifer water balance, which are critical elements needed for reliable projections of future conditions. The structure of the course will be lectures followed by student presentations based on follow-up readings and working with the extensive dataset from the High Plains aquifer in Kansas. The course will draw heavily on the short courses and workshops Dr. Butler has presented to practicing professionals and students over the last 15 years.
