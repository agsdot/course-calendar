LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:The scholar-politician Daniel Patrick Moynihan, famously said, &quot;Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.&quot; But the distinction between facts and opinion has been in endless dispute in modern as well as ancient times.  We will look at the foundations of science, in which facts are established by consensus, which may change over time; the distinction between the more or less Newtonian natural sciences and probabilistic social sciences, and the roles that models play in science. We will examine the social, cultural, and cognitive biases that lead people to strenuously adhere to false beliefs. We will consider the distinction between facts and values in public policy, and the role of evaluation and the movement for evidence-based policy making. And we will look at problems of facts in legal contexts, including defamation, the artificial facts allowed by the rules of evidence, legislatively and judicially determined facts, racial profiling, and the role of probability in legal decisions.  Readings will include the story of John Snow's discovery of the causes of cholera and Kathryn Schulz, Being Wrong: Adventures in the Margin of Error. We may also read or view some plays and movies.  Class meeting dates: The class will meet five Mondays from 6:30 - 8:30 p.m. on January 23, 30, February 13, 20 and March 6.  Winter Quarter.
