DESCRIPTION:What are the digital humanities?  A definition might be: Digital humanities are those pursuits which use digital tools to explore topics of humanistic inquiry.  But that definition is rather general.  To have a more nuanced understanding of the digital humanities, students will be exposed to a number of its practices, and practitioners.  Active engagement by all participants is expected.  Students will read and annotate, map and perform digital textual analysis. Ultimately, students will have a better idea of what the digital humanities are, and will be introduced to different ways they can be practiced, opening up possibilities for further exploration.
