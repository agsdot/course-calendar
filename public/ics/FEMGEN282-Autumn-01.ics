DESCRIPTION:Analysis of representations of queer lives in films from the Spanish-speaking world (including the U.S.). We will be looking at the meaning each film produces about a wide variety of queer experience, in relation to a specific national, historical and cultural context. We will also practice doing close readings of how each film produces meaning about queer experience, focusing on the formal features mise-en-scene, cinematography, sound, editing , narrative and style.
