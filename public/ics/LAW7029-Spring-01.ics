LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 394)  This course explores the world of legislation and administration that defines much of our modern legal order. By analyzing agencies, statutes, and legislative procedures, the course prepares students to think about the structures and processes of government, and how they influence legal outcomes that would otherwise be defined largely by social norms and common law adjudication. Drawing on examples from a variety of substantive areas, the course covers the legislative process, approaches to statutory interpretation, the role of agencies and the legislature in a system of separated powers, delegation to agencies, the interaction of common law doctrines and agency practices, and techniques of agency regulation and adjudication. First-year students are welcome. Special Instructions: Students who receive credit for Legislation (Law 319) and/or Statutory Interpretation (Law 425) may not receive credit for Legislation and Administration (Law 7029) and vice versa.  Elements used in grading: Attendance, participation in in-class discussion and simulation and occasional short assignments, being on &quot;panel&quot; for selected classes, and a self-scheduled open-book exam. CONSENT APPLICATION: To apply for this course, students must complete and submit a simple Consent Application Form available on the SLS website (Click Courses at the bottom of the homepage and then click Consent of Instructor Forms). See Consent Application Form for instructions and submission deadline.
