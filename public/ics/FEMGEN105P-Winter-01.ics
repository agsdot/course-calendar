DESCRIPTION:This 2 unit course will provide students the opportunity to explore possible honors topics, project design, advisor options, and university resources including grants, libraries, and faculty. nOver the 10 weeks, students will review related research, potential methodologies, explore creative genres, and consider summer research and preparation. Students will use their findings to write a proposal to submit to the honors program as well as a proposal to submit to UAR for undergraduate funding. After completing the proposal, students will have more clear next steps for their honors projects, including summer research needs, spring course selection as it relates to their topic, and building advisor relationships.
