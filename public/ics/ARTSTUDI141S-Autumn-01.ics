DESCRIPTION:The natural world has sublime, and beauty, as well as structure, unscenic nature, and surprise. This course will take students out into the landscape to draw both sides of this equation. What does it mean to once again remind us of the glory of nature and its both scenic, and unscenic qualities? We will begin to understand the history of sublime painting and drawing, as well as the concept of natural reality in light of Darwin, John Muir, Rachel Carson, and others. The contemporary world interrupts the notion of nature by adding man-made technology and domestication into the landscape; how does this impact representation? We will visit areas on the Stanford campus such as the Jasper Ridge, the Stanford Dish, the equestrian site: the Red Barn, Outdoor sports stadium, Hoover tower view, Vistas, Forests, Skies, and the edges of human encroachment will be areas worthy of exploring. Also, carcass, birds, and other animals in the landscape will be subjects as well. Staging the landscape with props and drawing these is another way to update the Plein Air experience. Studying the nuances of nature both its horror and its beauty is the contemporary subject of Plein Air drawing today.
