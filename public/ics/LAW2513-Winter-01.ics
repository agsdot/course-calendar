DESCRIPTION:While climate change is often considered an 'environmental problem', the risks and opportunities embedded in a changing climate go well beyond the frame of the natural environment. This course will reframe climate as a macroeconomic challenge, one in which multilateral politics, global investment and physical and institutional infrastructure must be understood and reconsidered. Based on scholarly analysis, case studies, and guest speakers, this interdisciplinary course will cover the past, present and future pillars of climate politics and finance. Starting with the key takeaways from past global climate negotiations, the bulk of the course will investigate current innovations at the intersection of finance and policy, including risk management and disclosure, blended finance, distributed solutions, and resilience measures. The final sessions will consider what is just beyond the horizon as future leaders embark on solving the greatest challenge of our time. Special Instructions: Grades will be based on class attendance, class participation, and a final solutions paper considering the design of a financial or policy intervention with the potential to reduce emissions on a gigaton scale.  This class is limited to 25 students, with an effort made to have students from SLS (15 students will be selected by lottery) and 10 non-law students by consent of instructor.
