DESCRIPTION:This seminar will explore when and under what circumstances humanitarian sensibilities, including the idea of human rights, became powerful components of modern politics and ethical thinking.  Far from being a straightforward ideology, humanitarianism has been invoked in myriad ways &iquest; both idealistically and cynically &iquest; in the course of modern history, in debates over phenomena as varied as slavery, colonialism, world war, genocide, famine, and immigration.  As a result, contemporary ethical motivations for assisting those in need remain deeply shaded by humanitarianism&iquest;s long engagement with political categories, ideologies, and practices of the past, including Christianity, race, liberalism, capitalism, and imperialism. We will examine the shifting narratives and media strategies that activists, NGOs, and governments have employed to draw widespread attention to crises and abuses from the late eighteenth century to the present.
