DESCRIPTION:Every story is in some ways a travel story, a journey from here to there. In this seminar we'll explore how different people in different times and places experimented with the travel-story form to make sense of their social worlds. We'll focus on the twentieth century, during which people, images, and ideas moved around the world at an unprecedented scale and with increasing speed. Some journeys take us across oceans, while others are limited to just a few city blocks. For a final project students may complete a standard research paper related to themes of the course, or may produce their own travel narrative, however they choose to interpret this rubric. nSPECIAL GUEST LECTURER: Pico Iyer, travel writer.
