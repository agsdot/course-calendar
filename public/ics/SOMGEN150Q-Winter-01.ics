DESCRIPTION:This course explores and challenges the physiological basis for distinguishing human &quot;males&quot; and &quot;females&quot;, expands the concepts of &quot;intersex&quot; beyond reproductive anatomy/physiology (i.e. beyond the genitalia), and discusses some known consequences of &quot;gender biases&quot; in medical diagnoses and treatments. The influence of gender (sociocultural) &quot;norms&quot;, i.e. gendered behaviors and relations, on human biology is juxtaposed with the role of biological traits on the construction of gender identity, roles and relationships, thereby focusing on the interactions of sex and gender on health and medical outcomes. Problems that may arise by labeling conditions that vary in incidence, prevalence and/or severity across the &quot;male-female&quot; spectrum as &quot;men's&quot; or &quot;women's&quot; health issues will be discussed. In addition, the importance of recognizing the spectrum of sex and gender, as well as sexual orientation, in clinical practice from pediatric to geriatric populations, will be highlighted, with consideration of varying perspectives within different race/ethnic, religious, political, and other groups.
