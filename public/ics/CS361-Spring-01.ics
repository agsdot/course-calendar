DESCRIPTION:Design of engineering systems within a formal optimization framework. Engineering often involves the synthesis of several disciplines, such as fluids, structures, and controls in aerospace systems. These disciplines interact in complex ways, making the optimization of the system design challenging. This course covers the mathematical and algorithmic fundamentals of optimization, including derivative and derivative-free approaches for both linear and non-linear problems, with an emphasis on multidisciplinary design optimization. Topics will also include quantitative methodologies for addressing various challenges, such as accommodating multiple objectives, handling uncertainty in evaluations, selecting design points for experimentation, and principled methods for optimization when evaluations are expensive. Applications range from the design of aircraft to automated vehicles. Prerequisites: some familiarity with probability, programming, and multivariable calculus.
