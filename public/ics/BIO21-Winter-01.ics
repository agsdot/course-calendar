DESCRIPTION:Based on the book Extreme Life of the Sea, this course will explore the new science about how marine species thrive in some of the world's most difficult environments. Species that live in the hottest, coldest, deepest and shallowest habitats will be described along with the genetic, biochemical, physiological and behavioral adaptations that allow them to persist. A major outcome is a blending of divergent ways of thinking, the narrative of science, and training about how to craft written narratives that bring science alive to people from all backgrounds. New science demands creativity and expression demands knowledge. This course blends the two ways of thinking by establishing two parallel tracks of lecture material - the science of ocean life, and the tools of the new field of creative non-fiction.
