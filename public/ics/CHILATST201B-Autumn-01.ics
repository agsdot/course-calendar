DESCRIPTION:Are you an artist seeking a greater purpose for you art? Would you like to gain a sense of history and best practices for engaging your community in creative work? nnPractice of and an awareness of the concerns relevant to public art did not begin with Serra's Tilted Arc in 1980s.  In contrast to the concerns of public art projects in the western practice of public art as extensions of the museum, this course explores the creative expression that emanates from community and cultural tradition. In communities around the world publicly engaged art making has flourished through creative tradition and collective engagements in social life.  These traditions fostered creative works as collective practice, democratic participation, and interventionist impulses.  From Agosto Boals's Theater of the Oppressed, to El Teatro Campesino's Farmworker actos&iquest;to the Free Southern Theater&iquest;&iquest; from the Fandango's of southern Veracruz, to muralism of Los Tres Grandes, and the SNCC Freedom Singers, this course links the history of community cultural expression of peoples around the globe as a means to expand contemporary concerns of public and socially engaged art beyond a strictly postmodern art context.
