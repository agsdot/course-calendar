DESCRIPTION:(Same as HISTORY 50C. History majors and others taking 5 units, register for 150C.) This course begins around 1900, when women and most African-Americans could not vote; automobiles were virtually unknown and computers unimaginable; and the U.S. was a minor power overshadowed by Europe. Yet fierce debates over the purpose of government and role of the U.S. in the world animated national politics, as they do today.  This course surveys U.S. politics, culture, and social movements to answer the question: How did we get from there to here?  Suitable for non-majors and majors.
