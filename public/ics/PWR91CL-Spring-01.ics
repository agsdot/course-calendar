DESCRIPTION:&quot;Self &amp; Science&quot; mines the intersection of memoir and science writing. In this advanced experimental writing course, students will read a selection of essays by writers including Lewis Thomas, Oliver Sacks, Annie Dillard, and Mark Doty, which illustrate the shared intellectual foundation in observation of scientific and poetic inquiry. Building on these readings, students will be challenged to produce an experimental essay that transgresses genre boundaries in the service of considering how personal reflection can narrate researched discoveries. Over the course of the quarter, students are invited to bolster their overall communication acumen, enhance their ability to share valuable discoveries beyond the confines of their major discipline, and practice the difficult bliss of engaging a discerning public audience.
