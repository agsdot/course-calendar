DESCRIPTION:Interdisciplinary research helps combine theories, concepts, perspectives, and methodologies, and is therefore critical to the advancement of science. This seminar will bring together students interested in race-related research from various disciplines (e.g., anthropology, education, political science, psychology, sociology). Through this seminar, students will broaden their familiarity with race-related research and learn how to communicate and collaborate with scholars outside of their immediate discipline. I will lecture every now and then, usually to provide background or introduction to a topic, but most of what you will learn will come from your peers. That is, this course will be minimally didactic; the goal is to maximize interdisciplinary conversations and collaborations, and to systematically review emerging theories, methods, concepts, and practices from various disciplines.
