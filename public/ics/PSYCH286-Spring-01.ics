DESCRIPTION:Our topic is the psychology of racial inequality &iquest; thinking, feeling, and behaving in ways that contribute to racial stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination, and how these processes in turn maintain and perpetuate inequality between racial groups. We will examine how these processes unfold at the individual level (e.g., person perception, dehumanization) and at the institutional level (e.g., in education, law enforcement, and employment). Throughout this course, you will familiarize yourself with the psychological perspectives, methods, and findings that help explain racial inequality, so that you can explore ways to promote racial equality. You will also engage critically with the issues and readings by sharing perspectives, confusions, and insights through writing and discussion, so that you can broaden your knowledge base and explain, from a psychological perspective, the pervasiveness of racial inequality.
