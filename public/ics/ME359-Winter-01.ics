LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:Designing For Safety In Labor &amp; Delivery will inform students about challenges in the L&amp;D environment through direct observation in a simulated environment and the hospital. Simultaneously, we will be studying the users: their environment, standard protocols, communication and behavior. Our goal is to identify need spaces that will lead to product, system or service innovation and improve safety and quality of care. Student groups will have structured access to OB/GYN, pediatric and neonatology clinicians at Lucile Packard Children&iquest;s Hospital, as well as parents for conducting ethnography. Field trips to Lucile Packard Children&iquest;s Hospital and The Kaiser Garfield Healthcare Innovation Center are planned as well. Physical prototypes and/or scenarios can be tested and presented at CAPE&iquest;s simulation lab in order to give students a realistic environment in which to evaluate and present their ideas. Prior design process experience is helpful but not a prerequisite. Collaboration with teammates is required and critical for student success. To be considered for admission, you must complete the application by 12/15/16 AND attend the first class. Admission by application. See dschool.stanford.edu/classes for more information.
