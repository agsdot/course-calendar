DESCRIPTION:Students use optical microscopy, x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and other techniques to characterize recently discovered perovskite semiconductors that can be used to make highly efficient solar cells. This course fulfills the Writing in the Major Requirement for MSE undergrads.  Instruction on writing, statistics, generating effective plots with curve fits, using databases to find information and giving oral scientific presentations is given.  Instruction on characterization techniques is provided, but it is expected that the students will have already taken a course like MATSCI 153 that covers the fundamentals of the techniques. The emphasis on this course is on doing nanocharacterization experiments and writing up the results. Undergraduates register for 161 for 4 units; graduates register for 171 for 3 units.
