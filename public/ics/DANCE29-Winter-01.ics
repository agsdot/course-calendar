DESCRIPTION:In this course students will be introduced to a series of contemporary dance warm ups and dance combinations that are drawn from a broad range of modern dance techniques, somatic practices and dance traditions of the African diaspora with a particular focus on Afro Brazilian, Afro Cuban and Haitian dance forms. No prior dance experience is required. Each class will be comprised of a series of warm up exercises and fun dance combinations that express the connection between western contemporary technique with dance traditions of the African diaspora. Dance combinations will consist of dynamic movement patterns that condition the body for strength, flexibility, endurance, musicality and coordination. Through these exercises students learn how to become expressive and dynamic movers and gain a deeper appreciation of the multiple expressions of what is known as contemporary or modern dance.
