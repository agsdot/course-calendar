DESCRIPTION:This course will provide opportunities for pre-service teachers to begin to develop an understanding of language uses, forms, and mechanics through application of a functional approach to academic language. By exploring language structures (phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics) as well as lanauge-in-use (pragmatics and discourse), teacher candidates will be able to better recognize linguistic demands and challenges of students in the classroom.
