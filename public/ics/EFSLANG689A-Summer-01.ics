DESCRIPTION:Develops familiarity with three of the most popular sports in the United States: football, baseball, and basketball. Beginning with an overview of the rules of each game and its history, students are introduced to the patterns of language that surround sports culture and pervade American communication even outside sports-related interactions. Students examine academic and popular sources on sports, focusing on the language of sports culture, metaphors, and idioms that occur in daily English language use through practice of the language forms both inside and outside the classroom. Intended for current graduate students and graduate summer visitors.
