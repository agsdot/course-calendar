DESCRIPTION:What was English like before Shakespeare? Before Chaucer? In this class, you will learn to read Old English the ancestor of Modern English, spoken and written by the Anglo-Saxons over a thousand years ago&iquest;and in the process, you will begin to unravel the mysteries of the earliest English literature. These mysteries include riddles and other puzzles that have baffled readers for centuries, but they also include modern mysteries caused by damaged manuscripts and allusions to characters and texts now lost to the ages. We will encounter all of these enigmas (and many more) throughout the quarter as we read texts such as <i>Widsith</i>, the Exeter Book Riddles, <i>The Wife&iquest;s Lament</i>, and <i>The Husband&iquest;s Message</i>. For your final project, you will have the chance to interpret one of them and offer your own favorite solution.
