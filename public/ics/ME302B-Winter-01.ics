DESCRIPTION:The objective of this course is to develop an understanding for the requirements that go into the design of a highly complex yet easy-to-use product, i.e. the automobile. Students will learn about very different interdisciplinary aspects that characterize the automobile and personal mobility. This is the second part of a 3-quarter seminar series, which build on one another but can be taken independently. This quarter, the seminar will discuss how various vehicle systems help drivers to maneuver their vehicles through traffic. Advanced driver assistance systems range from navigation, adaptive cruise control, night vision, and lane departure warning to automated parking, traffic jam assistance, and eventually self-driving cars. These systems play an important role in making traffic safer, more efficient, and more enjoyable. This course, lectured by an industry expert, will introduce students to the technology behind the systems, the benefits, challenges, and future perspectives of this exciting field. Students will develop an understanding for the interactions of the technology, business, and society with a specific automotive focus.
