DESCRIPTION:In this course, as we investigate the power of the archetype of discovery, we also critically consider what these stories hide or gloss over. How revolutionary are most discoveries after all? What perspectives are left out? What is a truthful way to portray new insights? How do we capture popular attention but include the broader context of experiment and expeditions? You will gain a complex understanding of how writing and rhetoric both structure and hide knowledge from the audience, and how you can use this in your writing in both persuasive and responsible ways.

Enrollment is handled by the PWR office.
