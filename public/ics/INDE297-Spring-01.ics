DESCRIPTION:Required for all MD students enrolled in clerkships at Stanford affiliated sites. Two-year curriculum designed to provide structured time for students to step back from clerkships, in order to promote reflection on and reinforcement for their learning in the clinical environment. Goals are: to discuss and reflect upon critical experiences in clerkships; to provide continuity of instruction in translational science topics across the curriculum; to reinforce and extend the study of behavioral, cultural, ethical, social and socioeconomic topics introduced in the Practice of Medicine course sequence; to expose students to recent advances in medical discoveries, emphasizing their application to clinical practice (translational medicine); and to develop research and critical thinking skills, acquiring new information in areas related to the Scholarly Concentrations. Components of this curriculum include Doctoring with CARE small groups, the Advances and Reflections in Medicine lecture/seminar series, and Scholarly Concentration breakout groups. The Friday afternoon lecture/seminars explore advances in biomedical sciences with applications to medical practice (translational medicine) as well as faculty career pathways, reflections on doctoring, and the context of medicine in society. All students in clinical clerkships must participate in all aspects of RRAP Days. Prerequisite: Concurrent enrollment in clinical clerkships.
