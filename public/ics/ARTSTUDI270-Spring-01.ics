DESCRIPTION:Students engage in professional photographic (studio) practices that prepare them to apply and extend the skills, methods and techniques they have learned in previous courses, including digital and analog shooting with digital print production. These practices involve working collaboratively, taking on short-term projects, handling an increased media work flow, actively participating in regular critiques, and contributing to and showing work in a small final exhibition. Students refine their aesthetic, tap the interdisciplinary network of influences they have built, and work independently to become adept at presenting their ideas and developing a portfolio to show the art they have produced to potential clients in a 'real world' professional context. This course may be repeated for credit. Prerequisite: ARTSTUDI 275, ARTSTUDI 278, or equivalent.
