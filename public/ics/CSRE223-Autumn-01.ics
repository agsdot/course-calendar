DESCRIPTION:We'd like to introduce you to Samantha Palmer, a recent Stanford graduate who majored in Psychology and took several design thinking classes at the d.school. At the d.school, Samantha became fascinated by the radical collaboration mindset. In her classes, Samantha would work with students from English, engineering, business, and medicine to solve real world problems. Working with students from a multitude of disciplines added layers of complexity to her ideas that she knew she couldn't have gotten by just working with other psychology students.nAs graduation approached, Samantha found a position at a large tech company in Silicon Valley and was excited to apply all she had learned through radical collaboration. Within weeks of starting, she realized that the academic world understood how to engage and actively embrace people with a variety of backgrounds, but organizations seemed to struggle to incorporate diverse perspectives. Even within her own team, she quickly realized that while there were employees from a variety of backgrounds, their thoughts and opinions were often rather homogenous.n nDuring Organizational Psychology of Design Thinking: Embracing Diverse Perspectives in the Workplace, we will visit creative organizations and together analyze the role that radical collaboration does or does not play across teams. Throughout the quarter, we will reflect together on the value of including multiple perspectives and the impact radical collaboration can and should have in creative work across Silicon Valley.n nThe deliverables at the middle and end of the quarter will prompt you to critically reflect on the organizations we visit and imagine how organizations might better be reimagined and redesigned to promote radical collaboration.nnIn order to be considered for this class, please fill out the application on the d.school&iquest;s website by September 9th: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJldz73qrksMUHPKTXV9N26aCE42qmL1jFjGhWgVlxgJeU2w/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1
