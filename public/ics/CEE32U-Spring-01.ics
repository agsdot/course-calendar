DESCRIPTION:This course will study at the development of Modernism in pre and post WWII California.  The class will investigate responses to climatic, technological, and cultural changes that were specific to the state but have now become an idealized tread.  We will look at architects and landscape architects who apprenticed with significant design leaders and track how their involvement and explore resulted in changes in building technologies, and influenced the next generation of design thinking and experimentation. The investigations will occur through research, drawings and models, as well as site visits.
