DESCRIPTION:For as long as there has been an American theatrical tradition, there have been controversies about it. From those creating theatrical performances, to those analyzing drama&iquest;s place in society, to audiences, people have strong opinions about the purpose, nature, and impact of US theater. This course will ask questions such as: What are the best casting practices with respect to race, gender, ability, and sexuality? How has the commercialization or Disneyification of Broadway changed the theatrical landscape? Should the federal government fund the arts, and if so, does that give them the right to influence content?
