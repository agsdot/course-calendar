LOCATION:McMurtry Building rm 115
DESCRIPTION:In this seminar, we will consider the body on screen as well as the body before the screen i.e. the spectator but also the profilmic body of the actor to examine corporeal performance and reception with respect to audiovisual media. The dancing body, the comic body, dead and live bodies, the monstrous body, the body in pain, the virtual body all raise questions about embodiment, liveness, and performance. Through a discussion of make-up, fashion, the labor of producing the idealized star body from the meat-and-bones of a body of the actor, or body genres where the spectator's body is beside itself with sexual pleasure, fear and terror, or overpowering sadness, we may inquire into ideologies of discipline and desire that undergird mediatized bodies.
