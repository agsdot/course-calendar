DESCRIPTION:Most of civil litigation is in tort.  As society changes, this dynamism is reflected in the progression and regression of tort law.  Taught by an experienced practitioner, this course will explore contemporary developments in the law of medical malpractice, product liability, mass torts, harms to reputation and dignity and other civil wrongs.  We will consider a range of remedies including compensatory and punitive damages as well as their constriction through tort limitations.  Knowledge of these substantive rights and remedies has greatest value if the arc and texture of suit is understood.  So we'll also learn about insurance, negotiation, settlement and alternatives to trial.  And we'll set all this in the broader context of how an attorney can guide a plaintiff or defendant to an appropriate economic and/or noneconomic remedy.  Elements used in grading:  Class attendance is mandatory and class participation is encouraged and valued.  There will be a final exam.
