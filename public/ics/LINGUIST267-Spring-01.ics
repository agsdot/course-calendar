DESCRIPTION:Panini's &quot;Astadhyayi&quot;, the most complete generative grammar of any language yet written, is the source of many of the principles and formal techniques of modern linguistic theory. Remarkably, in Pa 'n.ini's work these emerge just from jointly maximizing empirical coverage and minimizing description length. We review the overall organization of his grammar and its motivation, the levels of representation, the types of rules and constraints, and the principles that govern their application and interaction. Among the specific aspects of the analysis that we will examine are the thematic role-based syntax, the lexicalist analysis of word-formation and inflection, and the stratally organized phonology.  Course is 4 units.  May be taken for fewer units with prior approval from instructor.
