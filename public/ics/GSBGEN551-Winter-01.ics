DESCRIPTION:The health care system accounts for over 17% of US GDP and is one of the fastest growing segments of the economy. This two unit class focuses on the interplay and tension between the main players in the health care field - providers of health care services (individual doctors, group practices, integrated health care systems), payors (insurances companies, employers, consumers, and government), patients, and innovator companies (biopharma, medical device, diagnostics, and health care IT). The course is designed for students with a broad diversity of backgrounds and interests who want to better understand the health care business and system. No prior experience in the health care or medical field is assumed or needed. The focus of the class will be primarily on the US health care system, but there will be limited discussion of non-US systems as well. nnThe course is divided into four modules: n1. An overview of the US Health Care System and the interplay between payers, providers, and innovatorsn2. Provider organization models and incentive structuresn  - The relationship between quality, cost, and accessn  - Integrated systems and fee for service modelsn  - New IT technologies, including electronic data records, and incentives for adoption n  - How the delivery system structure affects technology innovatorsn3. Innovator business models and issuesn  - Financing and managing new product development and portfolio managementn  - Clinical trial management and gaining regulatory approvaln  - Marketing, communication and sales strategies (both physician and patient communication and sales) to drive product adoption and gain third party reimbursementn  - Business models to drive innovationn4. Health care system reform nnThe class will be taught primarily from the perspective of a business person operating a company rather than that of a policy maker, academic, or investor. While there will be a few lectures to provide background and frameworks for course topics, most classes will involve a case discussion and prominent guest speakers from the health care industry. Speakers and panelists last year included CEOs from Genomic Health, Tenet Health, Blue Shield of California, Jazz Pharmaceuticals,  Safeway, and Practice Fusion; venture investors from Venrock and Chicago-Pacific; and the Dean of Stanford Medicine.
