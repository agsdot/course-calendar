DESCRIPTION:This course will explore in detail ten of the most successful and long-lived technologies of human communication over the course of ten weeks. We'll examine the Rosetta Stone, Crazy Horse Mountain, the Voynich Manuscript, Banksy's Graffiti, Jackson Pollock's Lucifer, The London Illustrated News, Rihanna's `Work', the IPad, GoogleVR, and a nickel. We shall create biographies of these textual objects to better understand their effectiveness, the intentionality behind their creation and production, their affordances and functionality in the real world. Students will learn to describe and evaluate the major physical attributes and concepts that essentially underpin all forms of human communication. They'll then use this knowledge to replicate, augment, and reform current and historical text technologies.
