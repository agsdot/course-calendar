DESCRIPTION:(Same as STRAMGT 537) American public education is in crisis. What will it take to get it back on track? As in all large-scale enterprises in need of transformative change, leadership matters greatly. This course focuses on what it takes from a strategic and extremely practical perspective to lead change in public education at the systems level. We will meet some of the most exciting educational leaders in public education today and dissect their leadership styles, strategies, innovations and solutions. We will look for lessons from traditional U.S. districts, successful charter management organizations, and international perspectives to determine what it takes to be an effective leader in education reform. Students will debate the strategies and efficacy of how different leaders approached systems-level change, and will form their own working hypotheses of what is needed to help transform the American education system. The course will end with a look at education fellowship programs and other ways for Stanford graduates to take on meaningful leadership roles in K-12 education reform. Dan Katzir worked for Bain &amp; Company, Teach for America, and Sylvan Learning Systems before joining The Broad Foundation as its founding managing director. He is an experienced case study teacher and the editor of The Redesign of Urban School Systems (Harvard University Press, 2013). This course was designed to be taken in tandem with STRAMGT 535: Entrepreneurial Approaches to Education Reform and the courses will be highly complementary in approach.
