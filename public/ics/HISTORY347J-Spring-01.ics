DESCRIPTION:Scholars, like the English social historian H. Trevor-Roper and the philosopher-historian Georg Hegel, once denied that Africa even had a history worth telling.  We know better.  Rich accounts of African pasts have been constructed by historians who pioneered linguistics, oral tradition and folklore research, documentary analysis, archaeology, and other methods. At the same time, Africans' own accounts of the past are often passed down through memories and commemorations that are shared, disputed, and memorialized within their communities.  In many cases, historians and African communities manage to work together to construct shared understandings of the past, but sometimes their interpretations conflict with each other. In this course, we will look at the ways that history and memory overlap in Africa, beginning with the Atlantic slave trade and focusing on two particular events -- the Ethiopian victory over Italy at the Battle of Adwa and the abortive 19th century West African attempt to construct an independent state known as the Fante Confederation.  We will work with all kinds of primary sources from the past as well as music videos, architecture, documentaries, official celebrations, museum exhibitions, and performances to construct arguments that take into account methodology, ethics, and philosophy within and beyond the discipline of history.
