Special attention is given to law firms, courts and legal education. The course will be especially useful for those expecting to have contact with Latin American countries or Spain in their practice of law and for those interested in comparative law or Latin American studies. All required readings are in English. In addition, students may review and present elective readings in Spanish and Portuguese. The ability to read in these languages is appreciated but not required.  Elements used in grading: Class Participation, Written Assignments, Final Paper.
