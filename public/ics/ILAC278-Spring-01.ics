DESCRIPTION:This course will study the development of the dominant trends of early Iberian 20th-century lyric poetry, against the background of Restoration Spain (1875-1930), and the social and cultural forces of resistance and opposition to its oligarchical and archaic social and political structure.  We will concentrate on the major works of the three most important poets: Antonio Machado, Juan Ram&oacute;n Jim&eacute;nez, and Federico Garc&iacute;a Lorca.  Symbolist-modernist poetry, the creation of symbolic systems, and the brief appearance of surrealism all define key aspects of this avant-garde during the first three decades of the twentieth century. Special attention will be given to close stylistic analysis and to the historical and social conditions out of which arose the progressive intellectual and educational movement that gave rise to this renaissance of brilliant lyric poetry. Taught in Spanish.
