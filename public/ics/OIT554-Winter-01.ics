DESCRIPTION:This course offers an overview of information technologies for enterprises and supply chain management. The course has two key components - a series of guest speakers and a set of readings. Students are expected to have read the assigned note on related technologies before class, and prepare to discuss technologies with the guest speaker in class. We will not discuss the technology per se in class, so students who enroll are expected to have some exposure to technologies in order to digest the materials on their own. The main topics of technologies are: DBMS (Database Management System), ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), EAI (Enterprise Application Interface), data mining, Big Data, platform-based business model, cloud computing, RFID/NFC, mobile technologies, and mobile payment. In particular, students are encouraged to think hard about potential new businesses around the technology and discuss them in class.
