LOCATION:Cantor Arts Center
DESCRIPTION:This class considers Surrealism as a literary and artistic movement to explore the relationship between writing and the visual. The first part of the course will be devoted to looking at and writing about Surrealist theory, poetry, literature, objects, and paintings. We will then examine Surrealism's migration to Latin America, the United States, Japan, and Eastern Europe, and into media such as film and graphic design. How do art and ideas change as they move across cultural and material boundaries? What is the role of writing in encouraging and shaping this process? This course will coincide with The Conjured Life: The Legacy of Surrealism at Stanford's Cantor Arts Center. Required course for Art History majors. WIM Course. May be repeat for credit.
