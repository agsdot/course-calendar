DESCRIPTION:Is perception a passive capacity?  Or is perception essentially active in some interesting sense?  If the ability to perceive is partly the ability to do something, what is this ability? What might we learn about our relation to the world by studying this ability?nPhilosophical accounts of perception and action are two places in which the phenomenological tradition has provided exciting perspectives and useful criticism of orthodox accounts.In this tutorial, we will consider perception and action through some phenomenological lenses.  Regarding perception, we will consider Merleau-Ponty's view on which the ability to move through our environment structures our perception as significantly as does our retina's sensitivity to light.nThis tutorial will be valuable to students seeking fresh and stimulating perspectives on the nature of thought and action, as well as to students who are curious about Continental philosophy and how its achievements can be of use in contemporary philosophy and cognitive science.  Embodied cognition, the contemporary research program in cognitive science,has significant roots in phenomenology, and this tutorial will be useful to students seeking additional understanding of embodied cognition as a research program.
