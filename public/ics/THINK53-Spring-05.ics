DESCRIPTION:In this course, we examine how the ways we talk about food offers us a window into history, psychology, culture and economics.  We ask students to think critically about language and taste as well as explore the hidden meanings and influence of the language that surrounds us.  Students will analyze the language of food through menus, recipes, Yelp reviews, TV food shows, as well as the history and etymology of food words.  Some of our examples will be drawn from East Asian food and culture in addition to, and as a point of contrast with, foods and cultures that may be more familiar to students.
