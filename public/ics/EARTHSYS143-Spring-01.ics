DESCRIPTION:In this course, students will be studying the biosynthesis of cyclic lipid biomarkers. These are molecules that are produced by modern organisms that can be preserved in rocks that are over a billion years old and which geologist use as molecular fossils. However, to properly interpret these biomarker fossils, we need to fully understand how these molecules are produced in living organisms today. Students will be tasked with identifying potential biomarker lipid synthesis genes in environmental genomic databases, expressing those genes in a model bacterial expression system in the lab and then analyzing the lipid products that are produced. Through this approach, students may identify novel lipid synthesis proteins and novel lipid biomarkers that could impact how geologist interpret the molecular fossil record. The overall goal is for students to experience the scientific research process including generating hypotheses, testing these hypotheses in laboratory experiments, and communicating their results through a publication style paper. In addition, this course will allow students to directly observe how molecular microbiology research can be used to address geologically relevant questions.
