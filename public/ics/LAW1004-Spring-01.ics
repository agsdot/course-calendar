DESCRIPTION:From the United States to China, and from Brazil to the EU, corporate capitalism has triumphed globally as the dominant form of economic organization.  Yet despite the common attributes of the corporation familiar to every U.S. law student, corporations around the world have diverse ownership structures, interact in their domestic political economies in different ways, and exhibit a host of traits that vary with the institutional context in which they operate.  This seminar explores the many forms corporate capitalism takes around the world, and the important legal and policy issues raised by global corporate activity.  We will focus on Chinese state capitalism and the re-emergence of state ownership in the global economy, Japanese-style stakeholder capitalism, corporate groups prevalent throughout the world, and emerging forms of activist investor capitalism in the U.S. and elsewhere.  Policy issues to be considered include corporate social responsibility and the influence of corporations on transnational legal regimes.  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, Class Participation, Written Assignments, Final Paper.
