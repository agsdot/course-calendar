DESCRIPTION:In this lunchtime discussion series, students will explore psychiatry and behavioral science topics relevant to medicine through the personal perspectives of attending psychiatrists and other specialists in behavioral health from a variety of practice settings. Some examples of topics in the winter quarter are advances in interventional psychiatry, the interplay between social issues and mental healthcare, and other matters affecting the modern practice of psychiatry. Of note, this course discusses sensitive topics in psychiatry including suicide, psychosis, addiction, child abuse, sexual assault, violence, and mental disorders.
