DESCRIPTION:In this course we will examine dance and performing art practices that are rooted in the African American experience for social justice. Utilizing movement, writing and theater based practices we will explore the current issues that black Americans face in the struggles for joy, and racial, gender, and economic justice in the U.S.A. We will look at the work of black dance and performance artists from the period of the black power and black arts movements of the 1960s up to the present Black Lives Matters movement and examine how their performance work has served to catalyze and/or reinforce movements for justice.
