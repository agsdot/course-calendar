DESCRIPTION:This seminar examines the dynamic interaction at the highest levels of government and the media when news coverage of secret national security policy and operations impinges on United States defense, diplomatic and intelligence activities and decision making. A prime example: the torrent of secret NSA programs disclosed by Edward Snowden in newspapers and other media. Students explore attitudes, practices, and actions by the media and the government through a series of case studies and simulations. Former editors, reporters, and government officials appear as guest speakers, including Condoleezza Rice. The goal of the course is to inform students about the vital but often fraught relationship between a free press and the government in a democratic society, especially in the management of national security affairs. For advanced undergraduates and graduate students. Application for enrollment required. The instructor is a former Washington bureau  chief of The New York Times. Email Miles Lichtman (milesl@stanford.edu) to request an application. Completed applications are due by 6pm on March 19, 2016. Early applications welcome.
