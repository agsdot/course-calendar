DESCRIPTION:This is the first of a two course series that explores organizing principles of development at the cellular and tissue level. Students will learn the mechanisms by which cells polarize, interact with each other and their environment, divide, and generate force and movement and how these processes are utilized during the development of multicellular organisms. The course will also cover how cells communicate to pattern cell specification and morphogenesis during tissue and organ formation and during stem cell regulated homeostasis.
