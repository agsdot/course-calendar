DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 565)  This survey course will provide a foundation in immigration law, the system of admission and removal, and the constitutional principles governing the regulation of noncitizens.  The course will also explore selected topics concerning immigrants' rights and the normative values informing contemporary policies by drawing on the instructor's extensive experience litigating constitutional and civil rights issues on behalf of noncitizens throughout the country as well as serving as a senior immigration advisor in the Obama administration. We will examine such topics as immigration detention, state and local regulation of immigrants, constitutional prohibitions on 'alienage' discrimination&iquest; access to the courts to challenge removal orders, immigration reform and deferred action, protections for undocumented workers&iquest; Fourth Amendment issues arising in federal immigration enforcement.  No prior course or background in immigration law is expected.  Elements used in grading: Class participation and attendance (15%), final exam (85%).
