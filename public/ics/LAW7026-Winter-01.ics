DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 565) This survey course will provide a foundation in immigration law, the system of admission and removal, and the constitutional principles governing the regulation and rights of noncitizens. The course will also explore selected contemporary topics concerning immigrants' rights and immigration reform drawing on the instructor's extensive experience litigating constitutional and civil rights issues on behalf of noncitizens and recent service as a senior immigration advisor in the Obama administration. We will examine such current issues as immigration detention; state and local regulation of immigrants; constitutional prohibitions on 'alienage' discrimination; access to federal court to challenge removal orders; the intersection of criminal and immigration law; and recent federal reforms, including deferred action initiatives. Guest speakers may be invited for some topics.  No prior course or background in immigration law is expected. Elements used in grading: Class participation and attendance (15%), final exam (85%).
