DESCRIPTION:The course will present driving forces, comprehensive concepts, technologies,&nbsp;and managerial aspects of Industrialized Construction.&nbsp;Further a series of case&nbsp;studies of successful&nbsp;and failed industry implementations in Sweden, North&nbsp;America and Japan will be&nbsp;presented, showcasing process and technology&nbsp;platforms; use of renewable resources and other&nbsp;sustainable design and&nbsp;construction&nbsp;practices. The contrast between industrialized construction practices&nbsp;in Sweden, the U.S. and other countries is highlighted. Project-orientated&nbsp;vs. product-oriented&nbsp;approaches are essential, along with business models and strategies for industrialized&nbsp;construction&nbsp;companies and their opportunities for innovations. The&nbsp;course&nbsp;includes lectures, case studies, and course group-project assignments&nbsp;with&nbsp;leading companies in the industry.nnVisiting lecturer Dr Jerker&nbsp;Lessing, one of Sweden's leading experts on industrialized construction with&nbsp;more than 15 years of experience in this&nbsp;field, is giving this course. This is&nbsp;a unique opportunity to learn about this comprehensive, emerging construction concept.&nbsp;Dr Lessing's research at&nbsp;Lund University has pioneered the area of industrialized&nbsp;construction and established models and strategic perspectives that are widely&nbsp;adopted&nbsp;throughout academia and industry. Dr Lessing has published articles and&nbsp;books and he frequently lectures on the topic in Sweden and&nbsp;internationally. He&nbsp;is the Director and General manager of Research and Development at BoKlok, an&nbsp;industrialized house-building company which is&nbsp;a joint venture of the&nbsp;construction company SKANSKA and furniture giant IKEA. The class will be taught as a condensed two week course.  Readings and discussions will be organized in the weeks before the lecture component of the class, a group project after.  During weeks 1-5, class will not meet regularly and only meet a few times for reading discussions and guest speakers.  When they occur, these meetings will be held either Tuesday or Thursday 8-9am in Y2E2 292A.  A detailed class schedule will be available before the start of the quarter.nnNotes:nAttendance Mandatory.
