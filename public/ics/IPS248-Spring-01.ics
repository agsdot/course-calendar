DESCRIPTION:Establishing clear and consistent political-military objectives when waging limited wars is an essential but difficult task.  Efforts to develop coherent campaign strategies are complicated by competing interests among US government actors (diplomatic, development, military and intelligence), members of the coalition intervention force, and relevant international organizations.  This course will examine post-9/11 efforts to defeat Al Qaeda and stabilize Afghanistan from the perspectives of key US, international, and Afghan actors including the White House, State Department, Defense Department, Central Intelligence Agency, United Nations, NATO, Pakistan, and Afghan political elite and civil society.  Classes will include presentations by individuals with firsthand diplomatic and military experience in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
