DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 659)  Advanced Negotiation takes students beyond the two-party, lawyer-client negotiations that were the focus of the Negotiation Seminar.  Advanced Negotiation: Transactions places the student in more difficult and more nuanced simulations, working as individuals, pairs, and teams to negotiate on behalf of governments, unions and NGOs, as well as business entities. Simulations include critical-path supply agreements, vendor/collaborator contracts, cross-cultural joint ventures, airline reorganizations, big pharma arbitration resolution and big oil exploration negotiations. The goals of the class include acquiring a designer&iquest;s mindset for strategic preparation and tactical adjustment to changing scenarios; deeper analysis of the argumentative and persuasive elements of any negotiation; coalition formation and management, and improved tactical skills such as reading non-verbal cues, methods of questioning, response control, situational agility and, ultimately, improved confidence and competence.  Special Instructions: Attendance at and participation in all simulations and debriefing sessions is required. Passing is dependent upon this active participation, a series of short papers and in-class presentation. Prerequisite: Negotiation Seminar (Law 615) or its substantial equivalent, as assessed by the instructor. Elements used in grading:  Participation in negotiation and debriefs, thorough out-of-class preparation, and short papers..
