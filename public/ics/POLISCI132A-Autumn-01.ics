DESCRIPTION:Do you have a duty to vote?  How should you choose whom to vote for?  Should immigrants be allowed to vote? Should we make voting mandatory?  How (if at all) should we regulate campaign finance?  Should we even have elections at all?  In this course, we will explore these and other ethical questions related to electoral participation and the design of electoral institutions.  We will evaluate arguments from political philosophers, political scientists, and politicians to better understand how electoral systems promote important democratic values and how this affects citizens' and political leaders' ethical obligations.  We will focus, in particular, on questions that are particularly relevant to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, though many of the ethical issues we will discuss in this course will be relevant in any electoral democracy.
