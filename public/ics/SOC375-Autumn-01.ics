DESCRIPTION:Social order emerges not only from social forces that are cohesive in nature (cooperation, morality), but also ones that are divisive (hierarchy, inequality). This class reviews past work on these forces, with special attention on their micro-level impacts on interaction, as well as their macro-level impacts on political attitudes. Assignments: Students will complete several short proposed study designs and a final empirical project proposal. Prerequisite: Doctoral student in Sociology, Psychology, or the Graduate School of Business, or consent of instructor.
