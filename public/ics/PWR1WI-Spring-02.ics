DESCRIPTION:In this class, students in this course will explore the many ways communities of color have effectively used writing and rhetoric to persuade, to educate, to inspire, to awaken, to motivate. Some potential examples of materials include persuasive pieces written by formerly enslaved Black people to abolish slavery; letters written from Japanese internment camps, trial statements from Native American political prisoners; videos of Black Panthers' speeches; and comedy sketches by undocumented queer youth organizers. For more information about PWR 1, see https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/pwr/courses/pwr-1. For full course descriptions, see https://vcapwr-catalog.stanford.edu. Enrollment is handled by the PWR office.
