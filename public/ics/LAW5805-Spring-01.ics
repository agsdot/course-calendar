DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 652)  All nonhuman animals have been legal things that lack the capacity for legal rights for centuries. The struggle to extend legal personhood, which is the capacity to possess legal rights, to at least some nonhuman animals has turned to the courts. Lawsuits alleging that a captive nonhuman animal is a legal person entitled to her bodily liberty pursuant to  common law or civil law habeas corpus have been litigated, and continue to be litigated, in the United States, Argentina, Brazil, and Costa Rica. We will study what legal rights are, where they come from, and why humans have sometimes lacked them, as well as some of those lawsuits, the grounds they allege and the arguments they make, and arguments made against them by their critics.  This class will meet on Thursday the first three weeks of Spring Quarter (April 6, April 13, and April 20).  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, Class Participation, Final Paper.
