DESCRIPTION:In this seminar we will explore the variety of ways that sensory experience can be communicated through material culture. How did objects shape experience, and how was experience imprinted on objects? To answer these questions, we will move beyond narrative description to trace experiences that were not easily communicated or recreated, and that were ephemeral. We will discuss recent work across disciplines on the emotions, object history, experience, and the senses. All readings will be in English.
