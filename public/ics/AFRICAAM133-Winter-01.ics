DESCRIPTION:This course aims to equip students with an understanding of the cultural, political and literary aspects at play in the literatures of Francophone Africa and the Caribbean. Our primary readings will be Francophone novels and poetry, though we will also read some theoretical texts, as well as excerpts of Francophone theater. The assigned readings will expose students to literature from diverse French-speaking regions of the African/Caribbean world. This course will also serve as a &quot;literary toolbox,&quot; with the intention of facilitating an understanding of literary forms, terms and practices. Students can expect to work on their production of written and spoken French (in addition to reading comprehension) both in and outside of class. Required readings include: Aim&eacute; C&eacute;saire, &quot;Cahier d'un retour au pays natal,&quot; Albert Memmi, &quot;La Statue de Sel,&quot; Kaouther Adimi, &quot;L'envers des autres&quot;, Maryse Cond&eacute;, &quot;La Vie sans fards&quot;. Movies include &quot;Goodbye Morocco&quot;, &quot;Aya de Yopougon&quot;, &quot;Rome plut&ocirc;t sue Vous&quot;. Taught in French. Prerequisite: FRENLANG 124 or consent of instructor.
