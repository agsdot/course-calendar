DESCRIPTION:This course's goal is to critically engage students in the socioeconomic and racial disparities in healthcare outcomes and encourage students to think broadly about the complex relationship between institutions, healthcare providers, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity. The topics will center on conceptual issues important for understanding how socioeconomic and minority status can lead to poor health outcomes examining how conscious and unconscious institutional biases affect treatment, care, and access, and addressing proposals for how to reduce disparities in health care. nThe focus of the course is broad. The first three weeks will center on public health issues due to global healthcare trends, including the results of disparities in the United States. These discussions will frame our sessions int he latter sic weeks, which will each consist of a case study of specific cases of disparities and response to such inequities worldwide, from India to Rwanda. nEach class's discussion will be guided by case studies. The readings will come from a variety of sources, including academic journals, more popular journals and magazines, books and government documents. Student will be expected to complete the readings and a reflection in advance of class each week. Each week will additionally include optional readings that will guide additional discussion.
