DESCRIPTION:Students will develop an understanding of the chemical and physical processes of cement and concrete hydration, strength development, mechanical performance and durability. Students will learn how the properties of materials and admixture combine to create a wide range of cement-based materials used in the built environment. The course will address sustainable construction, including the use of alternative cements, admixtures, and aggregates. Students will apply the principles in this course to various aspects of civil and structural engineering, including innovative mix design specification and review, structural investigations and failure analysis, and cementitious materials research.
