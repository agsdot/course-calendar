DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 641)  This is a course in advanced and applied constitutional law. It focuses on one of the central ways in which constitutional claims are actually litigated: in lawsuits against public officials and local governments. The bulk of the course looks at litigation under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983. We will consider topics such as what it means to act &quot;under color of state law;&quot; absolute and qualified immunities; government liability for the acts of individual officials; remedies for constitutional violations, including monetary and injunctive relief; structural reform litigation; and the remedial issue nearest and dearest to many lawyers' hearts: attorney's fees awards. This course is particularly useful for students who plan to clerk in Federal courts, as much of their dockets involves &sect;1983 litigation. This course complements Federal Courts (Law 283) and students who plan to clerk will benefit from taking both courses.  Elements used in grading:  Participation, Attendance, Exam.
