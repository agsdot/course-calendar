DESCRIPTION:This class will explore the role of consumer search and firms&acirc; information provision with a specific focus on online markets and companies. Because the amount of information available to consumers has increased dramatically, it has become paramount for companies to facilitate consumers&acirc; search process. We will cover both the relevance for companies to reach consumers through their presence on third-party search platforms such as Google as well as how companies help consumers navigate through their own assortment by means of recommendation algorithms (e.g. Netflix, Spotify). Furthermore, we will discuss business models of companies that facilitate search by aggregating and presenting results from other vendors such as Kayak or eBay. Finally, we discuss new sources of information such as online reviews and consumer word-of-mouth on social media and how firms can effectively influence and manage those sources of information.
