DESCRIPTION:A combination of practical skill-building and real world experience, this course will provide students with the foundational skills necessary to work in the arts. Throughout the quarter, students will work in small groups with professional mentors to plan and produce an arts program in a public institution. This experiential learning will be interspersed with lectures on best practices in the knowledge areas they will be working through including curatorial practice and programming (for visual, performing &amp; community engagement); grant writing and other fundraising methodology; budgeting and financial management; contracts and other legal considerations; and public relations and marketing. Some of the class meetings will take place off-site. May be repeat for credit.
