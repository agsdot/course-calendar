DESCRIPTION:This course will offer students an introduction to Real Estate Development.  Senior Principals from Sares Regis, a regional commercial and residential real estate development company, will cover topics on all aspects of the development process.  Guest speakers from the fields of architecture and engineering, finance and marketing will participate in some of the classes.  They will offer the students a window into the world of how houses, apartments, office buildings and public facilities are conceived of, brought through the design and approval process, financed, marketed and then sold and/or rented.  There will be nine 1.5-hour lectures (robust class discussion encouraged). Throughout the quarter, the students will work on a group case study assignment about one local project that is currently being built or was recently completed.  This assignment will be due in the form of a presentation during the final exam period.  No prior knowledge of real estate is required.  Classes commence on April 6th and complete on June 1st.  Number of students is limited to 30.  Undergraduates must apply by submitting a one-page essay explaining their interest in taking the class to amabella@stanford.edu by March 1, 2017.
