DESCRIPTION:Data and Decisions - Accelerated is a first-year MBA course in probability and statistics for students with strong quantitative backgrounds. Probability provides the foundation for modeling uncertainties. Statistics provides techniques for interpreting data, permitting managers to use small amounts of information to answer larger questions. In statistics, we focus on the linear regression model. Regression analysis provides a method for determining the relationship between a dependent variable and predictor variables. We introduce topics from non-linear models and machine learning model selection. Students taking this course need to be comfortable with mathematical notation, algebra, some calculus, and be open to learning to write short programs in statistical software (eg R or Stata). If you are not confident with your quantitative abilities, then you should enroll in OIT 265. Accelerated D&amp;D will cover material covered in OIT 265 plus some additional topics such as discrete dependent variable models. While OIT 267 focuses on real world applicability, we will explore the mathematical underpinnings of these topics in more depth than OIT 265 as an avenue for deeper understanding. The group regression project is a key component of the course.
