DESCRIPTION:This interdisciplinary seminar examines current ocean issues and ideas through a series of readings, discussions, and guest lecturer presentations of seminal works about the complex relationships of human beings to the marine world. Through the lenses offered by several classic and contemporary readings and multimedia sources, we will examine and reinterpret the challenges of marine resource management, synergies between local, national and international marine policies, and current approaches to developing solutions to these challenges. This seminar is open to all undergraduate and graduate students who will have the opportunity to dig deeper into the foundations of environmental thinking about the relationship of human beings and the sea
