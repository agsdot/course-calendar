DESCRIPTION:How do we define cities and urban space, and why and how does that matter?  How did cities and urban space work in the ancient Mediterranean?  In this graduate seminar, we will work through some fundamental theoretical writings on cities and urbanism, including Childe and his critics, Weber, Lynch and Jacobs, LeFebvre, Hillier and Hanson, Harvey, Soja and others. We will explore the ways in which these ideas have been applied or could be applied to the ancient Mediterranean world, and we will read comparative material on other urban traditions to help us think through the issues.
