DESCRIPTION:This course explores theoretical, historical, and legal policy questions at the intersection of race, group identity, and national security.  Political events in the past year have intensified appeals to exclude, profile, and surveil groups of people based on their race or ethnicity, nationality, or religion.  Yet these appeals are neither new nor limited to any particular group.  This seminar aspires to understand contemporary questions in light of a broader theoretical, historical, and legal context.  The first section of the course is primarily theoretical, introducing influential perspectives related to the exercise of power in emergencies, democratic failure theory and its critiques, and critical approaches to national security law.  The second section of the course is primarily historical, investigating two episodes of twentieth-century U.S. history involving the confluence of race and security and the contested use of that history in contemporary policy discussions:  1) the internment of Japanese Americans in World War II; and 2) the intersection of the civil rights movement and national security frameworks during the Cold War.  The third section of the course focuses primarily on the post-9/11 period, exploring the construction of racial and national identities in the war on terrorism and investigating specific legal and policy questions related to national security policy, such as racial and religious profiling and nationality-based discrimination in immigration law.  Class attendance and robust participation in discussion is required, in addition to a research paper (of approximately 20 pages) related broadly to the themes of the course.  Students will be expected to discuss and submit an outline of their research paper while the course is in session and to submit the final paper in accordance with standard law school requirements.  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, Class Participation, Final Paper.
