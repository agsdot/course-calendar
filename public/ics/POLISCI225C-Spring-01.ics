DESCRIPTION:Americans have been trying to perfect their system of government since its founding.  Despite some notable achievements, there is a pervasive sense of frustration with political reform.  This course will examine the goals and political consequences of American political regulation.  Topics will vary by year to some degree but examples include campaign finance, lobbying, term limits, conflict of interest regulation, direct democracy, citizen commissions and assemblies, vote administration problems, transparency, and open meeting laws.
