DESCRIPTION:Prerequisite: PWR 1. Social media have greatly enlivened and democratized science communication so that it now moves between scientists and various audiences. Scientific content is no longer static, nor is it merely for advanced researchers. Scientists using social media are learning to assess content collaboratively to help provide better science in public communication. One of the particular obligations of university science students is to join the conversation, help review and revise content in the public sphere. Students in this course will actively engage in the evolving world of science communication and practice their scientific writing, research and oral presentation skills. For more information about PWR 2, see https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/pwr/courses/pwr-2. For full course descriptions, see https://vcapwr-catalog.stanford.edu. Enrollment is handled by the PWR office.
