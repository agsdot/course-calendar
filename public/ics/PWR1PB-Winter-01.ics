DESCRIPTION:Applying a rhetorical framework, we will discuss and analyze historical cases such as Barron v Baltimore (1833), in which the Court found that federal Bill of Rights guarantees were not binding upon states, as well as contemporary Supreme Court issues such as the debate surrounding the status of Roe v. Wade under the recently re-configured Roberts Court. We'll also discuss and examine the rhetoric of &quot;amicus curiae&quot; briefs, editorials about Court opinions, and pertinent lower court decisions. For more information about PWR 1, see https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/pwr/courses/pwr-1. For full course descriptions, see https://vcapwr-catalog.stanford.edu. Enrollment is handled by the PWR office.
