DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 674)  Building on the skills developed in Federal Litigation, this course will give students additional practice with legal analysis, argument structure, and writing in the pre-trial litigation context. Students will draft an office memo and summary judgment brief in an internet school speech case. Students also will complete short writing exercises in and out of class to practice skills such as omitting surplus words, preferring active voice, using concrete words, punctuating carefully, etc. The goals of this class are to help students organize facts and principles in a succinct and logical way and to deepen their understanding of the legal reasoning process. The course should appeal to students interested in litigation practice and those wishing to hone their writing skills.  Elements used in grading: Class participation, attendance and written assignments.
