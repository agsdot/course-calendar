DESCRIPTION:Fredric Jameson begins his famous 1990 essay: &quot;I am addressing a subject about which I know nothing whatsoever, except for the fact that it does not exist.&quot;  A quarter of a century later we are going to ask, does it now?  How does our sense of the world now register a new set of aesthetic, technological, and ideological formations?  What is a &quot;global positioning system&quot;?  What does it mean to walk through space these days?  We will look at major theoretical essays, as well texts from China, Palestine, and Los Angeles.  We will examine new cartographies, technologies, literary representations, all with a commitment to history and &quot;location&quot;, whatever that us, and an abiding question about ethics - what does it mean to &quot;take a position&quot;?.  Students will be encouraged to experiment with and introduce to us new modes of mapping.  Throughout we will strive to maintain both a spirit of exploration and of critique.
