DESCRIPTION:Lecture/Lab. First course of two-quarter capstone sequence. Team based project introduces students to the process of designing new biological technologies to address societal needs. Topics include methods for validating societal needs, brainstorming, concept selection, and the engineering design process. First quarter deliverable is a design for the top concept. Second quarter involves implementation and testing. Guest lectures and practical demonstrations are incorporated. Prerequisites: BIOE 123 and BIOE 44. This course is open only to seniors in the undergraduate Bioengineering program.
