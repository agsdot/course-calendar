DESCRIPTION:China's reemergence as a global player is transforming both China and the international system.  Other nations view China's rise with a mixture of admiration, anxiety, and opportunism.  Some welcome China's rise as a potential counterweight to US preeminence; others fear the potential consequences of Sino-American rivalry and erosion of the US-led international system that has fostered unprecedented peace and prosperity.  This course provides an overview of China's engagement with countries in all regions and on a wide range of issues since it launched the policy of opening and reform in 1978.  The goal is to provide a broad overview and systematic comparisons across regions and issues, and to examine how China's global engagement has changed over time.
