DESCRIPTION:This is a graduate level course that examines the dynamics of land use in relation to the multiple dimensions of globalization. The objective is to understand and analyze how the expansion of global trade, the emergence of new global actors, and public and private regulations affect land use changes. Beyond getting a better understanding of the dynamics of land use change, the course will enable students to better understand how to effectively influence land use change, from different vantage points: government, NGO, information broker, corporate actor. The main emphasis is on tropical regions. Lectures introduce various topics related to theories, practical cases, and evaluation tools to better understand and analyze contemporary land use dynamics. Data analyses will be conducted in the lab section, based on case studies.
