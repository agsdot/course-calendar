DESCRIPTION:Earth is the only planet in the universe currently known to harbor life.  When and how did Earth become inhabited? How have biological activities altered the planet?  How have environmental changes affected the evolution of life? Are we living in a sixth mass extinction? In this course, we will develop and use the tools of geology, paleontology, geochemistry, and modeling that allow us to reconstruct Earth&iquest;s 4.5 billion year history and to reconstruct the interactions between life and its host planet over the past 4 billion years. We will also ask what this long history can tell us about life&iquest;s likely future on Earth. We will also use One half-day field trip.
