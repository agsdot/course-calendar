DESCRIPTION:This course will center around three recent theatre plays associated under the auspices of what has been called Germany's postmigrant theatre: G&uuml;nther Senkel and Feridun Zaimo&iquest;lu's Black Virgins (Schwarze Jungfrauen), Nurkan Erpulat and Jens Hillje's Crazy Blood (Verr&uuml;cktes Blut), and Sasha Marianna Salzmann's Mothertongue (Muttersprache Mameloschn). Postmigrant theatre has been ushered in as a theatre movement that has successfully established and institutionalized new aesthetics, narratives, and political tools for artists of color and of different linguistic backgrounds in Germany. As a space where diversity is both explored and affirmed, postmigrant theatre and the abovementioned plays in particular attend to the intersections and tensions of religion and gender. Engaging contemporary political and social debates about representations of gender and Islam and queer identity and Judaism in the West, we will examine how theatre and performance forge new spaces of encounter, community, and even identity. Together with these plays, we will read texts from theatre and performance theories, women of color feminisms, gender performativity, homonormativity, and queer and trans of color critique. This course is designed as an introduction to postmigrant theatre and its theatrical intervention in contemporary thinking on gender and religion.nNOTE: This course must be taken for a letter grade and a minimum of 3 units to be eligible for Ways credit.
