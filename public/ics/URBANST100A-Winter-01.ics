DESCRIPTION:Is it useful to conceptualize housing through a human rights lens? Are there ethical tools that we can use to think about housing that can work on a variety of different scales? This one-unit course aims to explore ideas about human rights as they intersect with ideas about housing. We will begin the class by examining philosophical ideas of what exactly are human rights and then move through different scales of context to discuss what housing as a human right can mean on international, national, regional, and particular levels. During the trip at the end of the quarter, students will be provided opportunities to apply the metrics and methods of thought used during the quarter to think about housing justice and ideas about housing as a human right in the Bay Area.nnnTo be admitted to the course, students must apply by 11:59 pm on Friday, November 4 through the ASB website, www.tinyurl.com/stanfordasb2017nnnLimited to students participating in the Alternative Spring Break program. See http://asb.stanford.edu for more information.
