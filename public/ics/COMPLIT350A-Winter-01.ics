DESCRIPTION:A both historical and systematic retrospective on &quot;Marxism&quot; as the intellectual configuration and movement that most strongly influenced politics and the state of societies during the 20th century. Discussions will be grounded on a reconstruction of Marx's most canonized writings [especially &quot;Capital&quot;] as emerging from Hegel's work as their philosophical ground, and then proceed to a survey of &quot;Marxism&quot; in its most prominent forms of ideological and intellectual appropriation. Guiding questions [not rhetorical questions!] will be [a] what basic concepts developed by Marx have remained indispensable in 21st century world views and [b] whether &quot;Marxism&quot; today deserves more than an academico-antiquarian interest.
