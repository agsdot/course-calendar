DESCRIPTION:Sustainable Urban Systems (SUS) Project is a project-based learning experience being piloted for an upcoming new SUS M.S. Program within CEE. For a minimum 2 units (open enrollment,&nbsp;engineers and non-engineers, undergraduate and graduate level),&nbsp;students attend lectures/discussions on Tuesdays and labs/workshops on Thursdays and complete light weekly assignments.&nbsp;For an optional added 1-3 units (by application only), students are placed in small interdisciplinary teams and work on complex design, engineering, and policy problems presented by external partners in a real-world urban setting.&nbsp;Multiple projects are offered throughout the academic year and may span multiple quarters. Students are expected to interact with professionals and community stakeholders, conduct independent team work outside of class sessions, and submit deliverables over a series of milestones.&nbsp;For more information and to apply, visit&nbsp;http://sus.stanford.edu.
