DESCRIPTION:Since 2008's &quot;Food, Inc.&quot; the public discourse surrounding food economies, technologies, and sustainability has begun to consider: What are the possibilities in rethinking our food, the way we talk about it, the way we grow it, and the way we eat it? Food has long been identified as a socioeconomic marker, tied to income in ways that have material effects for individuals and communities, e.g. health disparities and food deserts. But who are the people and organizations working on the intersection of food and justice, and how can we, as writers, help them realize their goals? In this course, you will be paired with local organizations concerned with food economies, such as food activists, food banks, farmers, and farm collectives, to collaboratively draft and produce writing specific to the client. You will analyze and respond to a variety of professional writing situations, and practice project management, focusing on benchmarking and deliverables. The end result will be a multimodal, collaboratively-produced document or set of documents you can add to your public-facing portfolios. Students taking this courses as part of the Notation in Science Communication can include their final project in their NSC e-portfolio.nnThis course fulfills the advanced PWR requirement for the Notation in Science Communication (NSC).  Prerequisite: first two levels of the writing requirement or equivalent transfer credit. For topics, see https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/pwr/courses/advanced-pwr-courses.
