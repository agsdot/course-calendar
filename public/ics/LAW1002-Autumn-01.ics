DESCRIPTION:This course will take an in-depth look at the principles in US and EU competition law regarding conduct by firms that excludes or weakens rivals.  This is perhaps the most controversial and unsettled part of competition law and the part about which there is the least multinational agreement.  We will study, among other materials, some of the major recent cases in which the same or very similar matters were addressed by both US and EU competition authorities, including matters involving Microsoft, Google, Intel and Rambus.  The objectives are to gain a deeper understanding of the principles regarding exclusionary conduct and the ways in which those principles in US and EU law differ and, from that understanding, to draw inferences about the reasons for the differences between US and the EU law and the impact of different enforcement procedures on substantive legal principles.  Elements used in grading:  Class participation and written assignments or final paper.  This course is open to anyone who has taken Antitrust Law 233 and to others with the permission of the instructor.
