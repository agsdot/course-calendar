DESCRIPTION:[Note: This two-credit seminar accompanies Ethics on the Edge (Public Policy 134) but can also be taken as a stand-alone course upon permission from the instructor. Enrollment preference will be given to Public Policy majors seeking to fulfill the core requirement (and are required to do so) or upon permission of instructor. (The required course, Public Policy 103C, can be fulfilled by taking Ethics on the Edge (Public Policy 134, 3 units) and this Ethics on the Edge Public Policy Core Seminar (Public Policy 103E, 2 units) for a total of 5 units.) This course is not required for students taking Public Policy 134 to gain Ways of Thinking credit or to gain credit towards Ethics in Society, Science, Technology and Society, or general course credit.] The seminar-style course will explore additional foundational readings on organizational ethics (business, non-profit, and governmental organizations) and policy ethics. Themes will include race and police brutality incidents, national security; the Iran nuclear agreement; Brexit; non-profit organizations in the policy and US landscape; and various corporate matters. Organizing themes include, among others: ethics of leadership; ethics of persuasion and compromise; influence of bias in organizational and policy ethics; ethics of social movements; discrepancies between discourse and action; and interpreting and explaining ethics. In addition, the course will offer training in a wide variety of skills for effective communication of ethics for policy purposes (presentations, website discourse, commenting in meetings and conferences, interviews, statement of personal views, interacting with the media, prioritizing arguments, and mapping complex ethical analysis). Most of the assignments allow students flexibility to explore topics of their choice. The objective is to engage actively and improve skills in a supportive environment. A short, analytically rigorous final paper in lieu of final exam. Attendance required. Grading will be based on short assignments, class participation, and the short final paper. *Public Policy majors taking the course to complete the core requirements must obtain a letter grade. Other students may take the course for a letter grade or C/NC.
