DESCRIPTION:Prerequisite: PWR 1. As a rhetorical technique, humor holds unique persuasive power on a variety of political and cultural stages, evident in popular parody, satire, roasts, alternative news sources, public relations campaigns, and advertisements. Given this importance, we might ask, &quot;what makes humor persuasive?&quot; In this course, we will study humor through a variety of critical lenses, including those that examine humor as a unique appeal to pathos and those that argue it is entirely reliant upon logic. For more information about PWR 2, see https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/pwr/courses/pwr-2. For full course descriptions, see https://vcapwr-catalog.stanford.edu. Enrollment is handled by the PWR office.
