LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:For students interested in the history and contemporary practice of portrait photography. At a time when pictures are being produced and disseminated in unprecedented proliferation, and the 'selfie' has become a key part of popular photographic discourse, we will look at the complexities of portraiture in terms of skill sets and processes, aesthetics and styles, ideology and identity. The course is a hybrid of black &amp; white and digital photography, and will engage with such dualities as private/public, professional/amateur and traditional/innovative in the pursuit of capturing the self through the looking glass, beyond pose and persona. Assignments will include working individually and collaboratively with black &amp; white film as well as digital equipment, experimenting with different lights and lighting techniques, and research into resources ranging from personal family portraits to the Cantor Museum archives.
