DESCRIPTION:What conditions prompted the emergence of women political leaders around the world and what difference has their leadership made?  This course introduces students to global women's history and focuses on a series of individual women leaders in the 20th century.  We look at movements for women's self-determination in the 19th and 20th centuries that set the stage for women's emergence as national political leaders and activists in the 20th century.  We then focus on a series of global women leaders including Eleanor Roosevelt, Golda Meir, Margaret Thatcher, Benazir Bhutto, Michelle Bachelet and Aung San Suu Kyi.  By studying their biographies and historical contributions, we will explore the ways women leaders make distinctive contributions as heads of state and political activists.
