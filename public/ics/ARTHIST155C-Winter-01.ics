DESCRIPTION:The course will focus on American abstract painting from the 1930s to the 1960s, emphasizing the works of art at the Anderson Collection at Stanford.  We will focus on looking closely at pictures by Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Willem de Kooning, and other renowned abstract painters, developing skills of speaking and writing about these works of art.  We will also place these pictures in their mid-20th century context:  World War II and the Cold War; Hollywood and popular culture generally; Beat literature; and locations such as New York and San Francisco.
