DESCRIPTION:Course explores visible and invisible disabilities, women's psychological as well as physical health, and disabled women's identities and diversity of experiences.  Disabilities covered include blindness, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, arthritis, emotional and learning disabilities, and conditions requiring wheelchairs and other forms of assistance. We deal with issues such as who identifies as disabled, social and political dimensions, self-labeling, caretaking, stigma and passing, and the difference gender makes to how disabilities are experienced.  Course uses a personal approach and readings draw from first-person accounts by women. nNote: Instructor Consent Required
