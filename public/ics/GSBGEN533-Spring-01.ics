DESCRIPTION:Licensing of technology and its corresponding intellectual property is big business, and integral to the business plans and competitive strategies of start-ups and Fortune 500 companies alike. Although the annual dollar magnitude of licenses of patents and other technology-related IP is difficult to estimate due to the proprietary nature of much of the data, academic studies peg the U.S. IP licensing market at ~$66B, and the global market at ~$180B. The development and evolution of technology standards and interoperability requirements, regulatory overlays that require technologies outside a company's core competencies, the proliferation and widespread enforcement of patents, the rapid expansion of IP-based business models, and the staggering expense and uncertain benefits of internal R&amp;D, among other things, have combined to weigh heavily on the buy side of the make/buy scale, and to amplify the importance of inbound and outbound licensing arrangements for both start-up and Fortune 500 companies.nnBecause licenses are complex legal agreements with important legal consequences, it is tempting for business executives to delegate to lawyers the negotiation of the non-economic terms of their companies' technology license agreements. The problem with such an approach, however, is that 'non-economic' terms relating to license scope and duration, the extent of any representations and warranties to be offered, how and when and by whom payment will be effected and royalty calculations policed, indemnification against third-party IP and enforcement of licensed IP against infringers, the ownership and responsibility for patenting of improvements made to licensed technology, remedies for violation of the license, and many other issues, can and often do have significant and occasionally mortal economic and business consequences. While no business person should grapple with these issues in the context of a large or complex license agreement without legal counsel, it is critical that the business person understand the consequences and negotiating levers and trade-offs themselves, for at their core, the decisions to be made on these issues are business decisions, not legal ones.nnIt is the objective of this course to enable students to better understand and think critically about the principal issues that arise in the conceptualization and negotiation of technology license agreements, including those involving computer hardware and software, biotechnology and pharmaceutical compounds, medical devices, and other methods and products. As we address licensing arrangements in particular industries, business and licensing executives from companies active in these markets will participate in various class sessions, and will share with the students their experiences and strategic perspectives.
