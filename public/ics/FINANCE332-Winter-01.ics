DESCRIPTION:This course explores how economic and political forces interact to shape the financial system. The financial system is rife with conflicts of interests that markets fail to address effectively. The political process meant to correct these market failures, however, is itself rife with conflicted interests. We will discuss the roles, information and incentives of the key actors and show that politics often trumps economics in predictable ways. You will gain a better understanding of critically important and ongoing policy issues that will shape the financial system for years to come. Topics include the structure and role of banks and other financial institutions, housing and credit markets, central banks, global cooperation, governance and accountability, and the role of the media.
