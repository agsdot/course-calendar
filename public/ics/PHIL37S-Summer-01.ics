DESCRIPTION:What makes a law just? How should a judge interpret the law? When, if ever, ought I to disobey a law? In this course, we will consider central questions in the philosophy of law concerning the relationship between morality and law. Students will gain an understanding of the history of these questions by reading classic works of literature and philosophy, including Homer, Sophocles, Plato, and Aquinas, alongside contemporary scholarship on the philosophy of law. We will also apply this theoretical background to practice as students assume the roles of judges and attorneys and consider how relevant law in actual court cases should be interpreted. Students will gain a grounding in the history of the natural law tradition, legal positivism, and legal interpretivism, as well as wrestle with problems of interpretation faced by judges today.
