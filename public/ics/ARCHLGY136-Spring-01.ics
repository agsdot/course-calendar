DESCRIPTION:Advances in material science over the 20th and 21st centuries have greatly expanded archaeologists' tool-kit for studying the material remains of the past. In particular, isotopic chemistry has come to play an important role in answering questions of prime importance to archaeological research: How old is this artifact? Where did it come from? What did people and animals eat in the past? How did humans and animals move in the landscape? In this course, we will explore a variety of methods that use isotopic chemistry to answer anthropological questions about human lives in the past. The course will provide a background in the science of isotopic abundance and fractionation in natural and technological systems. It will also investigate wide variety of archaeological case studies that use chemistry to explore topics of anthropological interest, including: migration, technology, social inequality, food &amp; nutrition, human-animal interactions, and human-environment interactions.
