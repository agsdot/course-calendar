DESCRIPTION:In this course, students will contribute to ongoing community-based research projects focused on housing justice in the Bay Area. Students will work directly with local community organizations working in advocacy, legal aid, and community research. Projects may include interviews, historical research, surveys, case studies, participant observation, media analysis, and writing op-eds. Students will have the opportunity to select from research projects developed by the community partners and instructors. Students that want to engage in an alternative project should consult with the instructors. Students are encouraged to enroll for multiple quarters to develop more substantial projects and deeper relationships with community partners.
