DESCRIPTION:The aim of this course is to provide students with an overview of ethnographic, cultural, psychological and neurocognitive accounts of religious experience. Starting from classical work on the nature and variety of religious experiences, by William James, Alister Hardy and Andrew Lang among others, a taxonomy of religious experiences will be developed. We will focus on an in depth understanding of different types of experiences, such as sleep paralysis, hallucinations and visions, mystical and self-transcendent experiences, paranormal encounters and out-of-body experiences. For each of these phenomena contemporary theoretical explanations will be discussed, with a specific focus on the interplay between culture and cognition and on the relation with psychiatric disorders.
