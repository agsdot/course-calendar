DESCRIPTION:This is the 2nd quarter of a 3-quarter sequence. ME310A may be taken as a stand-alone course, and is a pre-requisite for ME310BC. It is designed for engineering graduate students seeking a start-up-like experience on projects related to sustainability, automotive interfaces, biomedical devices, robotics, and user interaction design. The ME310 Design Loft (bldg. 550 rm204) is your &acirc;start-up flight-simulator. In October student teams are paired with teams from overseas partner universities. At that time, global corporations will present break-through product innovation challenges. The Stanford and partner teams engage in design exploration using design thinking methodology including team-dynamics, rapid prototyping and human-centric problem framing. A final report, based on functional prototype testing, defines design requirements and user experience opportunities for Winter and Spring.
