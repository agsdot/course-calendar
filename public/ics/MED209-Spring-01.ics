DESCRIPTION:(Same as LAW 3002) Concerns about the quality of health care, along with concerns about its cost and accessibility, are the focal points of American health policy.  Considers how legislators, courts, and professional groups attempt to safeguard the quality and safety of the health care patients receive.  The course approaches &quot;regulation&quot; in a broad sense.  Focuses on regimes for determining who may deliver health care services (e.g. licensing and accreditation agencies), legal and ethical obligations providers owe to patients (e.g. confidentiality, informed consent), individual and institutional liability for substandard care, and various proposals for reforming the medical malpractice system.  Includes discussion of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (aka, &quot;Obamacare&quot;), which is launching many new initiatives aimed at assuring or improving health care quality.
