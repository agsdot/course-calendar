DESCRIPTION:This course is intended to introduce students to scientific thinking and help them develop the problem-solving skills needed to address biological questions. The course will focus on hot topics in infectious disease using a case study approach. Biological issues will be discussed at the molecular, cellular, organismal and community levels, through student-directed inquiry, hands on data analyses, group discussion, and independent projects. Students will learn how to form logical and testable hypotheses, analyze biological data, construct and test scientific arguments, and communicate scientific ideas verbally and in writing. Emphasis will be on evaluating diverse types of data and applying different approaches to develop an integrated and comprehensive view of selected topics. During class, students will work collaboratively to solve problems in small groups. Course instructors will engage with groups to explore questions and guide problem-solving. Instructors will also provide additional explanation and clarification for each case study as questions arise.
