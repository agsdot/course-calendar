DESCRIPTION:Every business has two kinds of problems: 1) Not having customers and 2) everything else. Marketing addresses the first problem. With increased access to information and fast-changing technology the role of marketing has broadened significantly. To attract and retain profitable customers, managers must identify and measure consumers' needs and wants, assess the competitive environment, select the most appropriate customer targets, and then develop multi-faceted marketing programs that satisfy consumers' needs better than the competition. The objective of this class is to provide you with perspectives on classical and modern day marketing, and to teach you how to take both a strategic and analytical approach towards contemporary marketing challenges.
