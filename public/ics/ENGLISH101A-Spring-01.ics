DESCRIPTION:Today, <i>Beowulf</i> is the most widely read piece of Old English literature, but how much can we really know about something written at least a thousand years ago? This class is about not only reading and comprehending the text of the poem, but also understanding what the story, its characters, and its heroic values may have meant to Anglo-Saxon audience, as well as what it may mean to us today. As we explore <i>Beowulf</i> in its historical, cultural, and literary context, we'll work to build a complex, multifaceted, and deeply contextualized reading of the poem.  This class can be taken as an advanced Old English language class or as an introduction to Old English literature and culture (mostly) in translation. Students without Old English experience should register for 3 or 5 units. Students with Old English experience should register for 5 units.
