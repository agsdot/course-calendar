DESCRIPTION:A brief look through today&iquest;s media sources exposes a wide range of representations of the Middle East that shape the way the world imagines the Middle East to be. As postcolonial theorist Edward Said explains, the &iquest;framework we call Orientalism establishes the ontological character of the Orient and the Oriental as inherently `Other&iquest;.&iquest; Building upon Said&iquest;s work on Orientalism, this course will introduce students to the ways in which the Middle East has been imagined, constructed, represented, and performed by the &iquest;West&iquest; (Europe and the U.S.) within both historical and contemporary contexts through dance, performance, and various forms of popular culture. Beginning with 19th century colonialism and continuing into the post-9/11 era, we will trace the production, circulation, and consumption of representations of the Middle East as they relate to global geopolitics. We will further examine dance, performance, and popular culture produced within the Middle East and Middle Eastern diasporic communities that respond to colonialism, nationalisms, globalization, displacement, secularism, and American Empire. Using Dance Studies and Postcolonial Feminist theoretical frameworks, we will consider the gender, racial, political, and cultural implications of selected works of dance, performance art, theater, film, photography, and new media.
