DESCRIPTION:How have writers on a global scale responded to a growing sense of environmental crisis?  How do various literary genres and forms help writers convey a sense of urgency, evoke feelings of loss, or prompt a call to action? Students will encounter recent stories, songs, memoirs, essays, and poems by writers from around the world that engage with the relationship between humans and our precarious environment. Texts such as Cormac McCarthy&iquest;s post-apocalyptic novel The Road, Inger Christensen&iquest;s long poem alphabet, and Arundati Roy&iquest;s fable &iquest;The Briefing&iquest; will allow us to see how race, class, and region impact experiences and depictions of a planet in crisis. These texts will also model options for students&iquest; own creative writing on nature, place, and crisis across genres. Assignments will include observational writing, experiments with genre shifts, and research and writing on the places we call home as members of a global community.
