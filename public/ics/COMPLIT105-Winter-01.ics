DESCRIPTION:The recent elections in the United States, the BREXIT vote, and the rightward movement in many European nation states all may be taken as indexes to the ways race plays a central role in politics.  Race and ethnicity show up in policies over immigration, refugees, citizenship, policing, incarceration, and other topics and issues.  This all puts tremendous pressure on human rights discourse.nnThe foundational document of modern human rights is the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, drafted at a time when the newly-established United Nations recognized the need for rights for a new post-war, and increasingly post-colonial world.  Our course will study the basis of human rights historically and philosophically with particular attention to the relation between human rights and anti-racist work.  What are the possibilities and challenges? nnA unique and exciting part of the course is that it is an international collaboration with classes at the University of Wurzberg, Germany, and the University of California at Merced. Using the Stanford-based TeachingHumanRights.org website, we will create a three-campus project that puts students and instructors together as an international community of scholar-activists.
