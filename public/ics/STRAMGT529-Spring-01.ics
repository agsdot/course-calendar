DESCRIPTION:In this class we will analyze the economics and strategy of marketplaces and platforms for goods and services.  We will consider the forces that have led to the proliferation of these marketplaces, as well as the economics behind which ones are likely to succeed and become profitable.  We will analyze the economic costs and benefits of these marketplaces for society, and consider the regulatory environment and challenges.  We will also study the microeconomics of managing these marketplaces: how should matching work, how can marketplace design solve problems of congestion or market thinness, and how a platform should trade off the welfare of the different sides of the market as it enters and grows.  Applications include ride-sharing and transportation; room-sharing and vacation rentals; on-demand labor and services such as babysitting, massage, manual labor; dating; and organized labor markets.
