DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 787)  The scandal of criminal justice in the United States is by now a familiar one, its facts well known. As the late William J. Stuntz wrote in The Collapse of American Criminal Justice: &quot;Rule of law has vanished in America's criminal justice system. Prosecutors decide whom to punish; most accused never face a jury; policing is inconsistent; plea bargaining is rampant; and draconian sentencing fills prisons with mostly minority defendants.&quot; There is no controversy that change is needed, and many believe we are now at a policy turning point. For the first time in nearly 40 years, prison populations are declining and a variety of forces--fiscal, political, and evidentiary--have come together to create broad-based support for reconstituting components of the American criminal justice system. Even though the political landscape has changed with President Trump's election, reformers still believe transformative change is possible. But good intentions are not enough, and a policy opportunity is not the same thing as a policy success. This historic opportunity requires a thoughtfully planned, multidisciplinary effort. This seminar is designed to engage in that effort. The class will discuss the reform proposals offered by experts in the recently published book Justice Future: Reinventing American Criminal (2017). Each student will be asked to select a particular area of potential reform (e.g., police, prisons, prosecution, sentencing, drug policy, parole release, risk prediction, juvenile justice, mental health, bail), and to offer a comprehensive concrete proposal for change. The final paper will offer plans for reconstituting that particular component of the criminal justice system. The proposals must be justified in terms of the pertinent legal and empirical research. The goal of each paper is to provide policymakers with a practical blueprint for choosing a different criminal justice future. This course is designed for students who wish to delve deeply into specific areas of criminal justice reform, and have an interest in policy reform and empirical research. This course is open to 1Ls, 2Ls, and 3Ls in the Law School.  Elements used in grading: Final Paper. Automatic grading penalty is waived. This course is designated as an &quot;R&quot; course, where the written product is substantial and based on open-ended research by the student. The final paper meets Stanford Law School's research (R) requirement. CONSENT APPLICATION: To apply for this course, students must complete and submit a Consent Application Form available on the SLS website (Click Courses at the bottom of the homepage and then click Consent of Instructor Forms). See Consent Application Form for instructions and submission deadline.
