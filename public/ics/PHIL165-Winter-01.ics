DESCRIPTION:Graduate students register for 265. NOTE: Phil 165/265 alternates topics yearly between &quot;Philosophical Issues in Quantum Mechanics&quot; and &quot;Philosophical Problems of Space, Time and Motion&quot;. The course may be repeated with a different subject matter. nnIn Winter 2017-18, the subject is &quot;&quot;Philosophical Issues in QM&quot;nnI. TOPICS: After introducing a simplified version of Dirac&iquest;s `bra-ket&iquest; vector space formalism for the quantum state (a.k.a. &iquest;&iquest; function&iquest;), the first third of the term is a historical overview of Heisenberg&iquest;s uncertainty relations, wave-particle duality, the problem of quantum measurement, and the non-classical nature of spin. We survey the treatment of these issues within Bohr&iquest;s doctrine of complementarity and the so-called &iquest;Copenhagen interpretation&iquest; of QM.  We review Einstein&iquest;s several arguments for the incompleteness of QM, leading up to the famous EPR (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) paper of 1935, the resulting issue of quantum entanglement as discussed by Einstein and Schr&ouml;dinger, and the complexities of Bohr&iquest;s response to EPR.  In the second third of the term, we examine a well-known `no go&iquest; theorem on EPR-type experimental set-ups stemming from Bell in the 1960s, according to which no hidden variables theory satisfying a certain locality condition (apparently assumed by EPR) can reproduce all the predictions of QM.  In the last third, we survey current variations of, or interpretive options for, standard QM:  Bohmian mechanics (a.k.a. &iquest;pilot wave theory&iquest;), &iquest;spontaneous collapse&iquest; theories, and Everett&iquest;s relative-state interpretation with its &iquest;many worlds&iquest;/ &iquest;many minds&iquest; variants.  We end by scrutinizing the recent &iquest;decoherence&iquest; program (a.k.a.&iquest;localization induced by the scattering of environmental particles&iquest;) that purports to explain the quantum-to-classical transition, i.e., the emergence of the world of classical physics and macroscopic objects and properties from quantum physics. We consider whether decoherence is justifiably viewed as solving the quantum measurement problem. nnII. PREREQUISITES: No detailed knowledge of quantum physics or advanced mathematics is presumed.  Some background in philosophy, natural science or mathematics will be helpful.  Students will benefit from possession of a modicum of &iquest;mathematical maturity&iquest; (roughly equivalent to a familiarity with elementary single-variable calculus or the metatheory of first-order logic).
