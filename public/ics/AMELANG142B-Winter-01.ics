DESCRIPTION:The focus of 142 A - C will be on the development of Yiddish literature.  The course will look at the changes in literary technique from the first literary experiments in the 16th century all the way to contemporary Yiddish writing.  Historical and cultural forces which shaped Yiddish writing will be discussed, thereby placing Yiddish culture within a broader European context.  Course material will include fiction, poetry, and critical prose, focusing on specific challenges for contemporary students in the language and cultural settings of works discussed.  Assignments will combine exercises that review essential grammatical principles with written work in Yiddish that analyze classroom readings.  Learning materials include as broad a range of sources as possible (written, recorded, spoken, sung), including contemporary realia from the religious and secular worlds.  Prerequisite: 142A
