DESCRIPTION:Prerequisite: PWR 1. Sport has become &quot;the&quot; international relations and development concept of the new millennium. As a result, sport development is a source of much praise and criticism as scholars, activists, philanthropists, and journalists struggle to understand the rhetorical games at play in the global sport development policy landscape. As students deepen their awareness of rhetorical praxis and explore new modes as writers and communicators, they will survey seminal scholarship, case studies, and grassroots activist campaigns surrounding sport development in preparation for a sustained research project that addresses the sociopolitical implications of tying sport to development in the 21st century. For more information about PWR 2, see https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/pwr/courses/pwr-2. For full course descriptions, see https://vcapwr-catalog.stanford.edu. Enrollment is handled by the PWR office.
