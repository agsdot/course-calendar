DESCRIPTION:An introduction to the aerodynamic design of rotor-based drones, for students with a background in robotics, aerospace, or fluids. Focus is on rotor-based drones operating at low Reynolds numbers, but material is applicable to drones, aviation and wind energy in general. Topics include: airfoil simulation, fundamentals of rotor aerodynamics, blade element analysis, rotor simulation and performance (e.g. mission duration, distance, maneuverability, and reliability). Midterm is the design of an airfoil for a drone, final is the aerodynamic design of a rotor for a drone; these projects will be peer-reviewed by students in the class.  Prereqs: background in fluid mechanics or aerodynamics; fluency with MATLAB. Recommended: take ME202 or AA241X before or after ME271, for practical applications in drone prototyping and control theory.
