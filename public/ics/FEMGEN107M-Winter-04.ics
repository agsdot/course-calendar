DESCRIPTION:Students in this course will interrogate masculinity and its impacts on culture broadly, with a focus on college campuses. Some questions considered will include: How do structures and expectations of masculinity impact sexual assault and response to sexual assault? Where on campus do we see pressure to perform masculinity? What expectations do some campus communities, such as athletics and Greek life, have of their members to perform and maintain masculinity? How are male identifying individuals expected to behave in communities shaped by masculinity? What spaces are there for gender non-conforming folks in communities shaped by masculinity? How do structures of masculinity impact expectations of femininity and femme in these spaces and others?
