LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:The American educational system revolves around success - but what exactly does &quot;success&quot; mean and who gets to define it?  The word &quot;success&quot; comes from Latin successus, meaning &quot;an advance or good result,&quot; and the verb succedere, &quot;to come after&quot; (chronologically). Now people use the word to refer to (a) the accomplishment of an aim, (b) the attainment of popularity or profit, or (c) a person or thing that achieves desired aims or attains prosperity.  In this seminar, we will trace the meaning of the word &quot;success&quot; through history, politics, and culture - straight into your lives as Stanford students.  What are mainstream notions of &quot;success&quot; and &quot;failure&quot; in the educational system today?  Who or what creates these categories and assigns people to them?  What are the consequences of these categories for our everyday lives?  What do &quot;success&quot; and &quot;failure&quot; mean to you, your culture and your communities?  Through discussion, reading, creative writing and reflection, we will interrogate &quot;success&quot; and &quot;failure&quot; from a variety of angles.  You will develop a deeper understanding of the various ways that these words are used, and you will be asked to develop your own personal, cultural and communal definitions.
