LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:Race is an endemic aspect of American higher education, from the founding of the colonial colleges for the education of young, white male elite to affirmative action in college admissions and more recently, student activism such as #blacklivesmatter. This one hour seminar will be a space to discuss current movements and issues with the framing of various scholarly treatments of race and education as a guide. Each week we will focus on one reading and one topic. Topics include: multicultural communities; the campus racial climate; affirmative action in college admissions; multiculturalism and the curriculum; and faculty diversity. Notes: Attendance at first class required. Seminar meets in the EAST House Dining Hall located at 554 Governor's Ave. The seminar is open to all students at Stanford with first-priority given to pre-assign residents of EAST House followed by other residents of EAST and all other undergraduates. Graduate students are allowed to enroll on a space-available basis. Visitors/auditors are not allowed. The seminar is required for all pre-assigned residents of EAST House and is repeatable for credit.
