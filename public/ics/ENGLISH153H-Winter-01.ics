DESCRIPTION:Whether you&iquest;re an avid programmer and an equally avid science fiction reader or an English major who designs apps in her spare time, you&iquest;ve probably had some experience switching between literary and technological modes of thinking, between following a story and debugging a script. What if these distinct cognitive styles could be combined? In this course, we will try to learn things about narratives by counting, clustering, and networking their contents, exploring the burgeoning field of digital humanities. We will practice some basic techniques of quantitative textual analysis, from identifying a text&iquest;s most distinctive words to determining its favorite topics and themes. But we will also find that these technical questions point us back to more basic interpretive or even philosophical ones: what is an author? What is a character? When we have a sense of a poem&iquest;s mood, what exactly are we responding to? When we feel suspense or anxiety while reading a story, how is the text creating that effect?
