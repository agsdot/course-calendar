DESCRIPTION:How are the post-WWII guerrilla wars in Algeria, Vietnam, and Iraq connected? How have French and American counterinsurgency planners applied &iquest;lessons learned&iquest; from prior wars? Are torture and violence against civilians the results of mishandled counterinsurgency, or are they inherent to the doctrine? Why have counterinsurgency strategies persisted despite long-term failures and public criticism? We will apply historical thinking to current debates by examining declassified government documents, films, photographs, music, television and radio broadcasts, memoirs, graffiti, and Oval Office tapes.  Priority given to history majors and minors.
