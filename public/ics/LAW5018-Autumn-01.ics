DESCRIPTION:This course will cover readings on the relationship between legal institutions and economic development across different countries. Some topics are set by the instructor, while others arise depending on the interests of students as they develop their paper topics. Topics in the past have included the role of legal and colonial origins, rights in property and contract, natural resources, political stability, governance/corruption, and social and economic rights. Readings will emphasize both broad themes and policy in these areas, with a special emphasis on considering varieties of evidence, including case studies, comparative history, statistical studies with observational data, and field experiments. No prior background in empirical methods is necessary or required.  Attendance, Class Participation, Final Paper
