DESCRIPTION:As educated consumers of scientific literature, we read reports of research findings in our everyday lives, sometimes though primary sources (e.g., journal articles) or through popular media reports of these sources. In particular, findings from cognitive development research often attract a lot of public interest, particularly from parents, caregivers, and educators, as these findings have implications for how best to educate young children. However, reports of scientific findings in cognitive development and their real-world implications often fail to convey the importance of tightly controlled experimental designs, the issues and challenges in conducting experiments, and the difficulty of interpreting the results and linking them to real-world practices in early education. This course originates from the idea that having a first-hand experience in the actual research process is an effective way to provide a deeper understanding of these issues, and help us become better consumers of scientific knowledge. nThis course is an advanced, lab-based research class in cognitive development, primarily offered for those who have completed PSYCH175 or equivalent. Students will conduct a replication/extension of a published study (or, depending on instructor approval, develop their final proposal into a research project if the project fits certain criteria). In this course, students will form a small research team and experience the role of an independent researcher to partake in the process of designing and conducting an experiment. At the end of the quarter, students will present their findings in front of a scientific audience and submit a full empirical report. nAll prospective students must have completed PSYCH 175 (or have written an equivalent research proposal on a related topic), and contact the instructor at least three weeks before the term begins for instructor approval. Student should expect to spend a significant number of hours outside the classroom for data collection. nnPrerequisites: PSYCH175 (strongly recommended) and instructor approval
