DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 471)  This course will provide you with an overview of the major issues typically covered in a First Amendment course including political speech, commercial speech, time place and manner restrictions, content based versus content neutral regulation, and government speech. We will also spend some time exploring contemporary First Amendment controversies including representations and concerns produced by the Trump Administration, challenges raised by different internet and cyberspace platforms, and various free speech issues related to contemporary forms of social protest.  This class is a &iquest;flipped classroom&iquest; course, meaning class will explore hypotheticals that require students to have read and digested the casebook materials prior to the first class meeting.  Discussions will foreground propositions from feminist legal theory, critical race theory and queer theory. While potential movement in Supreme Court doctrine will be discussed, emphasis also will be placed on how front-line legal actors understand current First Amendment doctrine and translate doctrine into policy and daily practice.  Elements used in grading:  Class participation, Final Exam.
