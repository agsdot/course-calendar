DESCRIPTION:This seminar series focuses on topics related to teaching science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) courses based on education research. Each year focuses on a different topic related to STEM education. This course may be repeated for credit each year. This year we will explore how to design assessments and give feedback to facilitate student learning through a series of discussions, in-class activities and guest lectures based on current STEM education literature. Throughout the quarter, there will be several opportunities for directly practicing and applying STEM education strategies to specific teaching goals in your field.
