DESCRIPTION:The rihla, or voyage, was an important part of many intellectuals&iquest; development in the pre-modern Arabophone world. This journey was understood not to mean just the physical displacement of a scholar over land and sea and as essential for his acquisition of knowledge at the feet of the foremost scholars of his day, but also as a metaphor for change, adventure, and intellectual development. Rihla also came to refer to texts written about these journeys, emerging in the 12th century as a term used to refer to a genre of travel writing&iquest;a grouping of narratives which will be the focus of our class. Readings will be drawn from such Arabic texts as Ibn Battuta&iquest;s Rihla, Ibn Khaldun&iquest;s Muqaddimah, and al-Ghassani&iquest;s Rihlat al-Wazir, as well as selections of European travel writing such as Marco Polo&iquest;s Travels. Emphasis, where possible, will be placed on continuing to develop the skills to read these texts in the original Arabic, including grammar, dictionary use, voweling, and translation.
