DESCRIPTION:The objective of this course is to survey the innovative automotive and transportation community within Stanford. Stanford University has become one of the best universities on earth to to change the future of transportation and this course is a 'who's who' of that world. This is the first part of a 3-quarter seminar series, which build on one another but can be taken independently. This quarter, the seminar will feature talks from Stanford experts in focus areas as varied as autonomous vehicles, entrepreneurship, design, ethics, aerodynamics, neuroscience, communications and security. At the end of the quarter, students will have developed an understanding of Stanford's portfolio of transportation work and know the specific individuals who are key to its future. To obtain credit, students must attend the first class (no exceptions) plus 7 additional classes for a total of 8 classes.
