DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 766)  Lawyers are increasingly asked to advise clients with global operations. This course will provide a foundation for understanding the types of challenges faced by business entities that operate around the world and that are therefore subject to multiple and sometimes inconsistent national laws. We will review some of the laws that apply to cross-border, multinational and foreign transactions and how variations in culture and legal systems affect the substance and application of those laws. We will also examine how treaties, international agreements and informal or political norms can constrain or supplement these laws and review the risks of doing business in communities whose laws are ineffective or unreliable. And we will consider some of the ways in which companies that do business in multiple nations can adapt to the challenges they will face.  Elements used in grading: Class Participation, Assignments.
