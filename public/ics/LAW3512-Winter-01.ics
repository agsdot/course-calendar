DESCRIPTION:What things should or should not be for sale - and why? This course will consider several examples of &quot;blocked exchanges&quot; or &quot;contested commodities,&quot; including the trade in reproductive services, body parts, environmental resources, political rights and obligations, and the varieties of human labor. With readings drawn from law, philosophy, and moral and political economy, the purpose of the course will be to examine a range of contemporary controversies over commodification and to consider arguments about the appropriate scope and limits of market activity. The assigned reading will be substantial, varied, and demanding.  Evaluation will be based on weekly reading responses and either an extended take-home exam (for 2 units) or, with permission of instructor, a final research paper (for 3 units).  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, Class Participation, Written Assignments, Final Paper.
