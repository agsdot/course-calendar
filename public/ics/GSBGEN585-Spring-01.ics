LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:GSB Graduates will be entering and re-entering the workforce needing to know and understand how to assess, create, broadcast, and maintain their personal brand. Project You will help each student realize: What is a personal brand and how can it be unleashed as a valuable, competitive advantage? Why do you need a personal brand?  How do you differentiate yourself and create a brand identity and strategy? How do you use social and traditional media to enhance your brand effectively as well as measure the metrics of social media responses? And how do you know when to pivot and evolve your brand for sustainability? GSB Lecturer, Allison Kluger, a former Television Executive and Co-Lecturer, Tyra Banks, Supermodel/Entrepreneur/Television Executive/Business CEO, will lead this class.  They will help students create their own specific image to support their brand, teach them how to navigate on-air exposure, and help them create a long-term strategy for how to promote their personal brand across several media platforms. This class will be a highly interactive learning environment with image transformations, live broadcasting of presentations at a television station, live streaming of portions of the class on Facebook Live, and YouTube recordings of presentations. Class participation and interactive class activities are part of the expected assignments. The class culminates with the students sharing their honed personal brand to the public via three viable platforms (Facebook Live, local television, YouTube) to jump-start their personal brand extension. A 1:00 original iPhone (or similar device) video stating &quot;Who you are, what your personal brand is, and why this class would be impactful for you?&quot; will be a mandatory requirement before Class #1. Once you get accepted, there is no option to drop out as there is a mandatory short survey that needs to be completed a week before class one. If you do not want your image broadcast across multiple platforms, this is not the class for you. There is also a mandatory additional class to broadcast final projects live from KMVT television station on Thursday, May 18th, 6-9pm Do not apply for this class if you cannot make this, or any of the other 6 classes.  If you can commit to these 7 classes, you will have a dynamic, transformational, highly interactive experience in which your personal brand will get seen by the public.
