DESCRIPTION:The physical actor is ever working to develop a wider range of emotional expression, an unconscious attentiveness to fellow actors, and a compelling presence that conveys a sense of truth in action and in word. In this course, students will explore movement as a means of physical training and performance-building. This course is for those interested in dynamic storytelling; no prior acting or physical training is required. Our work consists of four main components: physical conditioning, practical technique, movement improvisation and the creation of several short performance pieces. Through mime technique (from Tomaschevski and Decroux) students will increase precision and control, create images with the body, and examine basic compositional elements. Students will also learn the fundamentals of contact improvisation for theater, which offers actors another way to explore text and make discoveries about character. Exercises in movement composition will sharpen tools necessary for creating original work and crafting strong performances on stage.
