DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 577) This course is intended to give students a basic understanding of the themes in the legal regulation of elections and politics. We will cover all the major Supreme Court cases on topics of voting rights, reapportionment/redistricting, ballot access, regulation of political parties, campaign finance, and the 2000 presidential election controversy. The course pays particular attention to competing political philosophies and empirical assumptions that underlie the Court's reasoning while still focusing on the cases as litigation tools used to serve political ends.  Law students enrolled in this class will have the option of participating in a one-week extension of the course (Law 7056) in Delhi, India during spring break for an additional credit. Students may enroll for this course alone or for both this course and Law 7056.  The overseas option is limited to 12 students. (See Law 7056 for application instructions and deadline).  Elements used in grading: Class participation and exam. Cross-listed with Communication (COMM 361) and Political Science (POLISCI 327C).
