DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 661)  This advanced seminar explores how lawyers, diplomats, members of civil society, and citizen advocates can successfully negotiate agreements and pursue conflict resolution in the public international field. The course has a special focus on conflict and dispute resolution processes that take place in contexts where governing laws may be ambiguous, contested, or unenforceable. The goal is to help students learn how to critically evaluate and prepare to participate in these kinds of processes, with special attention to what their role as lawyers or legal advisors can be. Through simulations and case studies, the course will expose students to various types of international conflict resolution processes. These processes include track 2 processes, governance/civil society engagement (particularly regarding resource management, transparency and accountability, extractive industries), transitional justice (including reparations, truth-telling, reconciliation efforts, victim-perpetrator dialogue, restorative justice), peace treaty development, and DDR (disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of armed groups). Prerequisites: Negotiation Seminar (LAW 615), its substantial academic equivalent, or substantial experience in the field. SPILS students are especially encouraged to enroll. This course is also open to cross-registration by graduate students in a variety of departments and programs including International Policy Studies, provided that they have had sufficient prior background in negotiation. Any student deemed to be lacking the required foundational knowledge may still be admitted to the course, but required to attend an intensive bootcamp in basic negotiation theory and methods. Grading Criteria: The seminar requires that students do the required reading, actively participate in class and simulations, and to submit a series of short writing assignments.
