DESCRIPTION:Healthcare spending is now nearly 18% of the entire GDP of the U.S. economy. The S&amp;P healthcare sector has been one of the best producing segments of the market for the last five years, and growth of healthcare expenditures continue to escalate at a rapid pace. This has triggered an abundance of opportunities for those interested in a career in healthcare management, investing, or entrepreneurialism. The Business of Healthcare-2016 will present the current market framework from the eyes of a clinician and with the perspective of the consumer-patient, but with the experience of a successful business builder and investor. Course will begin with the discussion of the channels of distribution of healthcare delivery, from providers, to practitioners, to consumer-facing &quot;healthcare lite&quot; sectors of the market. Impact of the regulatory environment, with specific focus on the Affordable Care Act, will be evaluated. Overview of venture and private equity investing will be deeply probed, with many specific market examples of how investors develop an investment thesis, identify specific targets, diligence companies, and close an investment. High-level discussion around building financial modeling for target acquisitions will be presented, and the course will delve into the burgeoning area of healthcare analytics and outcomes management and its future impact on positioning, reimbursement and clinical outcomes. Sectors that will be discussed include: healthcare services, healthcare IT, Life Sciences, Pharma and Biotechnology, and Managed Care. Course will include preparatory readings, presentations from industry leaders, and robust in-class discussion requiring student engagement. Final grade will consist of in-class participation, one minor in-class presentation, and a final paper developing either a new healthcare business start-up proposition or presenting an identified investment target in the healthcare industry. Course will be especially valuable for those interested in a career in starting a healthcare company, healthcare investing, healthcare administration, or other healthcare-related entity business.
