DESCRIPTION:Originating in ancient India, yoga went through many developments over more than 4000 years in India and other parts of Asia.  Having migrated to Euro-America in the late nineteenth century, today yoga is everywhere--studios, schools, gyms, malls, resorts, ashrams, retreat centers.  It comes in many flavors&iquest;austere, with meditative instructors and Sanskrit chants; stylish, in 105-degree heat, with portable-miked instructors loudly motivating students to go through poses with speed and intensity; niche-crafted to meet the needs of busy professionals, pregnant women, senior citizens, or people with back problems.  It may appear as a spiritual path or as a heavily marketed commodity.  It generates lawsuits as teachers dispute ownership of certain styles, or as some Americans oppose its teaching yoga in public schools.  In the first half of the course we will study the history of yoga in India, reading primary texts composed between about 500 BCE and 1600 CE.  In the second half we will learn about yoga's globalization in the last century.  Participating in a yoga class is recommended. 2 units  of independent study (S-NC) are offered for those who participate in a weekly yoga class and write short reflections on the experience.
