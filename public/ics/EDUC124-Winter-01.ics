DESCRIPTION:The course introduces participatory design models for the development and research of educational materials through a studio-based, partnership driven, technology-integrated curriculum project. The special topic taken up in 2018 will be concussion education for youth. This is a studio experience working collaboratively with students, parents, and athletic coaches to design, field test, and make recommendations about learning activities and technology use for a complex curriculum that will engage immersive 360 3D technologies and social media. We will partner with TeachAids, an international nonprofit, on the curriculum development.
