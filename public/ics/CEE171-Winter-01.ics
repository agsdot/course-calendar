DESCRIPTION:Intended primarily for juniors and seniors; first year graduate students welcome. Course introduces key environmental policy design and implementation concepts and provides opportunities to work with a range of environmental planning methods. Environmental laws and regulations (e.g., US Clean Water Act and the US National Environmental Policy Act) are examined. Course demonstrates how firms have gone beyond regulatory compliance and introduced environmental sustainability issues into core business strategies. Course uses a simulated negotiation of a financial penalty between a student team representing the US EPA (and other government agencies) and a team representing a firm that is out of compliance with Clean Water Act regulations. Professionals with experience in such negotiations provide coaching for student teams. Prerequisites: MATH 51. Recommended: 70.
