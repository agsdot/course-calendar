LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 735)  In 2013, the City Detroit became the 28th city to declare municipal bankruptcy or to enter a receivership for fiscal crisis since late 2008, marking a window of time that saw five of the six largest municipal bankruptcies in American history. Despite the end of the Great Recession, serious fiscal challenges remain for many urban and rural local governments.  This course will focus on these places and what they need from state and local government. Rather than a survey of municipal bankruptcy or restructuring law, the course will function as a seminar on state and local governance in the face of decline and poverty, especially due to the loss and automation of industrial employment. Subjects will include: (1) the basics of local finance; (2) an introduction to the primary causes of local fiscal distress; (3) tools for state and federal governance of city finances and financial distress (including municipal bankruptcy and state receiverships); and (4) the local public sector's role in anti-poverty work. The course will feature readings focused on places (both urban and rural) across the country, including in California, Oregon, the Northeast, the Great Lakes/Rust Belt region, and the Appalachian region.  Students will have two options for this course.  In Section 1, students will enroll for 2 units of course credit. Section 1 grades will be based on class participation and weekly reflection papers of 3-5 pages each week for most of our topics.  In Section 2, a smaller number of students will enroll for 3 units of course credit.  Section 2 grades will be based on an original research paper for R-Research Paper credit.  Completion or co-enrollment with Local Government or Land Use Law is advisable but not required. Elements Used in Grading: Class Participation, Attendance, Written Assignments. CONSENT APPLICATION: To apply for either section of this course, students must complete and submit a Consent Application Form available on the SLS website (Click Courses at the bottom of the homepage and then click Consent of Instructor Forms). See Consent Application Form for instructions and submission deadline.
