LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:(Formerly Law 735)  In 2013, the City Detroit became the 28th city to declare municipal bankruptcy or to enter a receivership for fiscal crisis since late 2008, marking a window of time that saw five of the six largest municipal bankruptcies in American history. This course will focus on these cities and what they need from state and local government. Rather than a survey of municipal bankruptcy or restructuring law, the course will function as a seminar on state and local governance in the face of decline and poverty.  Subjects will include: (1) the basics of local finance; (2) an introduction to the primary causes of local fiscal distress; (3) tools for state and federal governance of city finances and financial distress (including municipal bankruptcy and state receiverships); and (4) the local public sector&iquest;s role in anti-poverty work. The course will feature readings focused on places (both urban and rural) across the country, including in California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan, Oregon, and the Appalachian region. Grades will be based on class participation and weekly reflection papers of 3-5 pages each week for each of our topics.  Completion or co-enrollment with Local Government or Land Use Law is advisable but not required.  Elements Used in Grading: Class Participation, Attendance, Written Assignments.
