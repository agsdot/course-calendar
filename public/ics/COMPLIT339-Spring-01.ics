DESCRIPTION:As we entered the new millennium, literary studies took yet another &quot;turn&quot; (after its linguistic and cultural turns).  We will examine the historical context for the &quot;ethical turn,&quot; some of its key texts and debates, and read a number of literary works to see how they might both manifest and resist an &quot;ethical&quot; reading.  At base we will question why literature was, and perhaps still is, considered a good vehicle for ethical thinking. How are notions of &quot;otherness,&quot; &quot;dignity,&quot; &quot;narrative,&quot; &quot;responsibility&quot; each inflected differently? Texts by Spinoza, Levinas, Butler, Cavavero, Coetzee, Octavia Butler, LeClezio, Al-Koni, Toni Morrison, Dorfman, Ghassan, others.
