DESCRIPTION:Advanced Design Studio will help magnify your design skills, expose you to design-related positions after Stanford, and coach you through working on a project of your own devising. As a key component of the project-based course, students will engage and work with professionals in a range of creative roles. If you want to explore design and its applicability at a higher level, this course is for you.nnIn addition to design project work, Advanced Design Studio will build on introductory design thinking skills and specifically focus on advanced practice in the following:n(1) Making at higher resolution (sketching, graphic design, intentionality, and specific tools such as the x-acto, laser cutter and vinyl cutter)n(2) Synthesis (noticing, reframing, mapping, insight-finding, and ambiguity-navigating)n(3) Communicating (scoping projects, writing, vocalizing intent and vision, recognizing when you've found something interesting, and critique)
