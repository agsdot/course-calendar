LOCATION:McMurtry Building rm 370
DESCRIPTION:A collaborative consideration of Robert Altman&iquest;s prolific and varied work as a director.  The course will examine well-known films such as the narratively and stylistically innovative Nashville, creative genre revisions such as McCabe and Mrs. Miller, The Long Goodbye, and Gosford Park; and the culturally iconic M.A.S.H.  We will also pay close attention to less famous work such as Secret Honor, and Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull&iquest;s History Lesson with the aim of describing and assessing a complex oeuvre.  There will be a course bibliography, but required reading will be relatively light to make time for both careful and extensive viewing.
