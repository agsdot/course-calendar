DESCRIPTION:This two part graduate level seminar and studio course is required for second year JPD MFA students, and open to second year JPD ME students and all MFA art practice students. The first quarter of this course examines artists as contextually engaged problem solvers and provocateurs. What strategies have artists used to draw attention to, and drive change regarding issues they care about? How is art used to change habits, shift the directions of cultural discussions, and make the invisible visible? We will study artists and designers who use innovative techniques to these ends such as Merle Ukeles, Krzysztof Wodiczko, Eduardo Kac, Jon Rubin, Amy Franceschini, Alfredo Jaar, Stamen Design (cab spotting), and Rebar. In addition to readings and discussions, students will create and critique a series of four studio projects that engage participants to rethink a specific site or situation.
