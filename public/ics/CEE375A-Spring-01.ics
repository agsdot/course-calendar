LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:Students in this course will review and discuss current literature on the water, climate, and human health nexus. We will review the climate-change projections from the most recent IPCC assessment and discuss their implications for water access and human health, with an emphasis on low- and middle-income countries.  Each student will take responsibility for leading at least one class discussion, and will write a research proposal describing novel research on the water, climate and human health nexus.  Course enrollment is capped.  Permission to enroll must be obtained from the instructors through an application process.
