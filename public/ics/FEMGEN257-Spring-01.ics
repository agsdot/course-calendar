DESCRIPTION:How does a social or political movement gain traction? For example, how did 20th-century movements of the disenfranchised, such as the Civil Rights movement or Women's Suffrage, gain a voice an eventually enact change? In the mediascape of today, where everyone with access to a computer has voice, how does a movement like Occupy Wall Street change the national conversation?  How do written and verbal choices of the movements impact their success?  In this course, students will write and revise their own arguments in order to best understand the writing in these movements and to best produce future work for social change. We'll examine the role of rhetoric&iquest;the use of argument to persuade&iquest;in social movements working toward social justice.
