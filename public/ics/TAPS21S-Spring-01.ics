DESCRIPTION:This class prepares students to tell their stories in front of the Beyond Sex Ed audiences in three performances for all freshmen, sophomores, and juniors, Fall 2017. What is sexuality education? In this class, you will learn about sexuality from the inside-out. We will examine social discourses that shape our understanding of sexuality and then dive into an experiential workshop to discover the many facets of sexuality through the art of story -- our own and others. Due to the sensitive nature of the topic, we will emphasize safety, trust, and confidentiality throughout. The class will offer you the structure and guidance to 1) mine your lives for stories, 2) craft the structure and shape, and 3) perform with presence, authenticity, and connection.
