LOCATION:GSB Class of 1968 110
DESCRIPTION:In this class, you will learn techniques for improving your spontaneity, creativity, presence, and collaboration skills, all of which contribute to your becoming a more effective and inspirational leader. This class is based on the techniques that improv actors use on stage when they make up scenes, songs, or even entire plays on the spot. Improv teaches you to do many things at once: be completely present, think on your feet, quickly get in sync with others, read the room, and be agile at using what the situation presents you. As a leader in business, you will benefit from this same skill set.  Whether you are presenting to your board, brainstorming &amp; designing with colleagues, or mentoring new talent - learning some building blocks of improv will give you valuable new tools for interacting effectively with others.  The course will cover topics such as storytelling, effective brainstorming, understanding and using status, creative collaboration, and risk taking.
