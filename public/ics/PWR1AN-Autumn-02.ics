DESCRIPTION:This course seeks to explore the ways that we read and write ourselves into a world that is engrossed in Hip-Hop culture by asking: What does it mean to live in a world where Hip-Hop permeates every aspect of society? How can Hip-Hop culture be used to understand the rhetoric that is used in broader society in reference to both this moment in history and the culture itself? By engaging both Hip-Hop artists such as Kendrick Lamar and Nicki Manij, and artists that operate in a Hip-Hop world like Beyonc&eacute;, this course investigates the ways that we write ourselves into a world engrossed in Hip-Hop culture that denies the humanity and value of its members.

Enrollment is handled by the PWR office.
