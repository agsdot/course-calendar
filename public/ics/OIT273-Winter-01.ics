DESCRIPTION:This course is about how to use entrepreneurship and innovations in the value chains to create values in developing economies. The course will cover important principles and ways in which the value chains can be re-engineered or new business models can be designed to create values. In addition to materials covering a diversity of industries and geographical regions, the course will also enable students to be exposed to some of the interventions that the Stanford Institute of Innovation in Developing Economies (SEED) is working on in West Africa. Work and exam requirements: Students are expected to develop a project report on either portfolio companies related to SEED or other enterprises to show how value chain innovations can be advanced.
